xlviii THE LIFE OF THE

in complaints and supplications of such a strain„ as every one
who reveres his memory will wish he had never u'ttered. T hose
who insist on the meannesS, those who plead fosr 'the dignity‚
of human nature, may, in this one man, find abundant mat—
ter to support their several opinions. But, letus drawa veil
over imperfeffions, and at the same time acknowledge, that a
very ordinary penetration may serve to discover remarkable ble-
mishes and failings in the most comprehensive minds‚ inthe
greatest characters, that ever adorned mortality.
Α . 6⁸- Kmo James died in 162 53 after an inglorious and a fatal
reign of three and twenty years: despised by foreigners, despised
and hated by his own subjeets. The mischievous notions he
broached‚ the perverse condu& he held, gave rise to those di-
vifions that quickly aster involved his kingdoms in all the guilt
and misery of a civil war: that ssiook the Britifh constitution
to its foundations, and in the end overturned it; tho appa-
rently framed to last for ages, as it had been ages in building
up and perfeeting.

Hrs unfortunate Chancellor survived him something above a
year. The multiplicity of business and study in which he had
been long engaged, but above all the anguish of mind he se-
cretly laboured under, had undermined and broken into his
health. After having been for some time infirm and declining,
he owed his death at last to an excesS, not unbecoming a phi-
losopher; in pursuing, with more application than his strength
could bear, certain experiments touching the conservation of
bodies. He was so suddenly struck in his head and stomach,
that he found himself obliged to retire into the Earl of Arun-
del’s house at Htghgate, near which he then happened to be.
There he fickened of a fever, attended with a defluxion on his
Arx-1626. breast3 and, after a week’s illness, expired3 on the ninth of
W* April, in the fixty-fixth year of his age. How he bore this in-

dispofition‚ or what discourses he held at the nearer approaches

of death, no account. is to be found3 an omiffion which every

reader must feel and regret: as nothing can awaken the atten-

tion, nothing affe& the heart of man more strongly than the
behaviour of eminent personages in their last moments3 in that

only scene of life wherein we are all sure, later or sooner, to
