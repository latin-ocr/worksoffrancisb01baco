xlix THE LIFE OF THE

certain members of both houses, the Lords agreed to take the
matter into their speedy consideration. As soon as this affair
was become the public talk, a new croud of accusers appeared,
and charged home the unhappy Chancellor with other and fla—
grant instances of bribery3 such persons especially as had courted
him with presents‚ and afterwards received a verdiet unfavour—
able to their expectations: animated more by that disappoint-
,ι res-s ment, than by the iniquity of his decisions; for it does not ap—

this while confined to his house by an indispofition, real o'r
pretended: but, if his body was in health, what must have
been the condition of his mind, in this interval of suspense and
