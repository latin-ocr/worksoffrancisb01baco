LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. xxix

time of his influence under two reignS, an influence supreme

and unbounded, that he ever projeeted one scheme for the be

nefit' of his country, or ever executed one undertaking to its
honour: the onlyg orreat Criterion by which we ought to judge
those men that administer the public, The breaking off the
Spanifh match at last was solely a sacrifice to his own vanity

and resentment. On the caprice of this youth, however, the

first and ablest men in the kingdom were to depend entirely,

for their access. at court, for their advancement, for any oppor-
tunity of being able to serve their country and their Sovereign.

,, Sinrancis Baton was sensible of this, and courted his friend-

ssrip with a particular application. But he must have felt all
the·servitude and disagreeableness of his situation, when, to be

well with the King, he found it neceffary to turn Steward to fgsssjeltffl:
theestate-newly bestowed on this young man ; to study the ¹63- ’
ways and means of improving his lands, and of rendering his
places most profitable to him. It is true he found his account

111 this service3 as it proved the surest mean 3 οΓ 1113 own prefer-
meut: but, to a great and worthy min 111, preferment so meanly
obtained is disgrace, only a little disguiscd and gilded over.

Tua Lord Chancellor Εσεφῑοη, broken with age and infir- C ⁷²⁷⁷ Ᾰι,
11111163, had often petitioned the King to be dismiffed from hisp’
laborious employment He was now severity seven years old,
and had presided 111 the court of Chaucery from the year 1596,
with an unblernilhed reputation as a judge in private cases ; but
his public conduct had been always sramed to the directions of
the court with an obsequiousness‚ of dangerous example in one,
who held so great and important a trust. To this high dig-
nity Sir Francis Bacon privately aspireti: and as it was the
utmost scope of his ambition, 116 had aimed all his endeavours
in the King' 3 service to merit it at his hands. He took care, at
the same time, to strengthen his pretensions by the credit of
Buckingham. H 13 ambition even made him descend to artifices,
that are as common in court8‚ as they are mean and unwar-
rantable3 for he endeavoured to ruin in the King's good opinion
such men as the voice of the public might probably defign to the
same office, and whom he therefore considered as his rivils
He was particularly jealous of Sir Edu ard Colce, and repre· ‘ft IV
sented him as one who abounded in his own sense; one who
affeffited popularity, and likely to court the good will of thc
