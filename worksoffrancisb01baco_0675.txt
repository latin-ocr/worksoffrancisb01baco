*THE trees in the cold countries ate such as are fuller of rofin, pitch‚
tar, ,⁷ which are matters apt for fire, and the woods themselves more com-
bustible than those in much horter countries; as for example, fir, pine—
apple‚ juniper: Q. whether their trees of the same kind that ours ate, as
oak and alh, bear notin the more cold countries, a wood more brittle and
rady to take fite than the same kinds with us?

THE sun-beams heat manifestly by reflexion, as in countries pent in with
hillasssupon' walls or buildingS, upon pavements, upon gravei more than
mh, upon arable more than grasS, upon rivers if they be not very
open, &a
: Tm: uniting or collection of the sun-beams multiplieth heat, as in burn-
ing glass'es, which are made thinner in the middle than on the fides (as 1 take
it‘,5 contrary to spectacles) and the operation of them is, as 1 remember, first
to place them between the sun and the body to be fired, and then to draw
them* upward towards the fim, which it is true maketh the angle of the cone
strarper. But then Ι take it if the glass had been first placed at the same dis-
tance, to which it is after drawn, it would not have had that force, and yet
thalmud been all one to the lharpness of the angle. Qu.

Soin that the sun's beams are hotter perpendicularly than obliquely, it
muyssbe imputed to the union of the beams, which in case of perpendicularity
refleet into the very same lines with the direct, and the further from perpen-
diewlatity the more obtuse the angle, and the greater distance between the
dire& bearn⁴ and the refleaed beam.

THE sun-beams raise vapours out of the earth, and when they withdraw

they fall back in dews.

³?2T-HE sun-beams cause the divers returns of the herbs, plants and fruits of
the earth3 for we see in lemon-trees and the like, that there is coming on at
onee‘fruit ripe, fruit unripe, and blolsom55 which may shew that the plant
worketh to put forth continually, were it not for the variations of the ac-
eones-and recess‘es of the sun, which call forth, and put back.
.. Tan excessivo heat of the sun doth wither and destroy vegetables, as
well as the cold doth nip and blast them.

Tne heat or beams of the sun doth take away the smell of flowem, speci-
ally such as are of a milder odour.
-ι THE beams of the sun do disclose summer nowers, as the pimpernel,
marigold‚fand almost all flowers else, for they close commonly morning
and evening‚ or in over-cast weather, and open in the brightness ofthe sun ς
which is but imputed to dryness and moisturc‚ which doth make the beams
heavy or εἰς-’,ἃς and not to any other propriety in the sun-beams: ,so they
