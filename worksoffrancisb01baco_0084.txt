use of mankind3 not to triumph over an enemy by the so·
phistry of disputation, but to subdue nature it self by ex-
periment and enquiry. As it differs from the vulgar Logic in
its aim, it varies no less from that captious art in the form of
demonstrating: for it generally rejects syllogism, as an instru-
ment rather hurtful than serviceable to the investigation of na-

Not the trivial method of the schools‚ that, proceeding on a
fimple and superficial enumeration, pronounces at once fro'm
a few particulam, exposed to the danger of contradictory in-
stances: but an induction that examines scrupuloussy the expe-
riment in question, views it in all poffible lights, rejects and ex·-
cludes whatever does not neceffarily belong to the subject ; then,
and not till then, concluding from the affirmatives left. A
croud of instances might be brought to shew how greatly this
method of enquiry has prospered in the hands of the moderns 3
and how fruitful it has been of new discoveries, unknown
and unimagined by antiquity. But I will only mention one
that may stand in place of many; the Optics of our immortal
Newton .· where, in a variety of experiments, he has analyzed
the nature and properties of light itself, of the most subtile of
all bodieS, with an accuracy, a precifion, that could hardly
have been expected from examining the groffest and most pal-
pable. From whence, by the method of Induffion, he has
raised the noblest theory that any age or country can shew.-

imprad'ticable‚ merely for being new, This our Author fore-
saw, and endeavoured to obviate, in the third part of his In-
stauration 3 by furnissiing materials himself towards a natural
and experimental history : a work which he thought so indis-
pensably neceffary, that without it the united endeavours

’ perfect the great structure of the sciences. He was aware too,
that even men of freer and more extensive notions, who relished
his new LogiC, might be deterred from reducing it to practice,
by the difficulties they would meet with in experimendug,
according to the rules by him prescribed. He therefore led the
way to other enquirers‚ in his Sylva Sjtlvarum, or history of na-
ture: which, howeverimperfect in many respee'tS, ought to be
