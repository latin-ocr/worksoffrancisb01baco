LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. xlvii

solid, comprehensive, systematical; the disposition of his whole
plan throwing light and grace on all the particular parts. In
considering every subjeffit, he seems to have placed himself in a
point of view so advantageous and elevated, that he could from
tliencetdiscover a whole country round him, and mark out the
several spots of it, distinetly and with ease. These characiers
are equally due to the works in which he made some 'progresS‚
and to those he could only attempt.

His supposed poverty has been much insisted on, not only 'Imm
by our own writers, but by foreignerS. Some of the former have
asserted, that he languished out a solitary being in obscurity
and indigence: and among the latter, Le Clerc, who was led
into the same notion by a passage in one of Howel's letters, has
animadverted with an honest indignation on the meanness of
that Prince, who could leave such a man as he was to struggle,
in his declining age, both with penury and affliffion. Ι believe
the matter has been exaggerated. Perhaps he did not enjoy
affluence or entire ease of fortune: but his ordinary income must
have placed him above sordid want and anxiety. Dr. Rawley,
who lived long in his family, affirms that the King had given
him, out of the Broad Seal and Alienation Office, to the value
of eighteen hundred pounds a year3 which, with his own lands
amounting to a third part more, he retained to his death. But
then, he had treasured up nothing in his prosperous condition
against the day of adversity: and his penfion was not only pre-
cariOUS‚ but ill—paid, by a King, who, instead of husbanding
his revenues for great or good purpose5‚ was daily lavishing them
away, in fruitless negotiations, or on the least deserving of his
subjeffitS. Add to these things, that my Lord Bacon lay all this
time under the incumbrance of a vast debt3 and that he had
doubtless expended very considerable sums in procuring or
making experiments. Even those, whom we see close and
’ sparing on every other occasion, are yet profuse in gratifying a
favourite passion. From all which arose that distress and those
difficulties into which he was often plunged. That they were
many and great, we can entertain no doubt ἦ. It is but too
strongly confirmed to us by some unusual expressions in his let-
ters to King James; where we find him pouring out his heart Bmm· ³⁷0¹·
