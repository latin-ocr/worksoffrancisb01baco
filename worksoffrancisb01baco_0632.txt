CERTIFICATE TOUCHING

and were content to give a trifle to a·

void charge.
Wmcn point of form hath a

{hrewd consequence: for it is some
ground that the fine isset too weak.

AND as for the informer’s oath
touehing his eompofifion, Which is
commonly a trifle‚ and is the other
ground of the smallness of the fine, it
is no doubt taken with an equivoca-
tion: as taking such a sum in name
of a composition, and some greater
matter by some indite& or collateral
mean.

Aeso these fines (light as they be)
are seldom answered and put in pro-
cess.

2. A N information goeth on to
trial, and paffeth for the King. In
this case of recovery, the informer
will be satisfied‚ and will take his whole
moiety‚ (for that he accounts to be no
compofitionz) that done, none wii'l
be at charge to return the postea, and
to procure judgment and execution
for the King. For the informer hath
that he fought for, the clerks will do
nothing without fees paid‚ which there
being no man to prosecute, there can
be no man likewise to pays and sothe
King loseth his moiety‚ when his
title appears by verdier.

3. 11· falleth out sometimes in in-
formations of wcight‚ and worthy to
be prosecuted‚ theinformer dieth‚ or
falls to poverty‚ or his mouth is stop·
ped, and yet so as no man ean charge
him with composition, and so the mat-
ter dieth.

4. Tu ER Ε be sundry seizures made,
in ease where the laws give seizures,
which are released by agreements un-
derhand, and so money wrested from
the subjest, and no benefit to the
Kin g.

A L L seizures once made ought not
to be discharged, but by order ofthe

court, and therefore some cntry ought
to be made of them.

z. ΤΗ 13 officer is to follow f'or'the·
King, that the ‘Postea’s be returned.

3. THE officer in such ease is to in-
form the King’s learned counscl, that
they may prosecute if they think fit.

4. T H E officer is to take knowledge
of such seizures, and to give informa-
tion to the court concerning them.

T H 1 s is of more difficulty, because
seizures arc matter in fact, whereas
suits are matter of record: and it may
require more persons to be employed,
as at the ports where is much abuse.

THER E be other points whcrein the officer may be of good use, which
may be comprehended in his grant or instructions, wherewithI will nor now

trouble your Majcsty, sor I hold these to be the principaii.
