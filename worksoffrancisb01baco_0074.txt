THE L1FE oF THE·

'troversy in person. rThe Monk, who relates this affair with a
most circumstantial exaitnesS‚ adds that the Emperor en-

treated Pope Adrian to procure him certain persons, who '

might teach his subjeets the first principles of grammar ,and
arithmetic 3 arts that were then utterly unknown in his domi-
nions. This warlike Monarch, tho his own education had
been so far neglected that he had never learned to write, dis-
covered, by his natural good sense, the value of knowledge, and
set himself to be its promoter and patron. He even allowed
'a public school to be opened in the imperial palace, under the
direfflon of our famous countryman Alcztin3 on whom ¹he
chiefly relied for introducing into France some tin-sture of that
philosophy which was still remaining in Britain. But how
ssow and ineffectual the progress of any learning must have,
been, we may guess from an ediec of the Council of ,Challons,

¹ - in the neXt century3 which earnestly exhorts all monasteries

to be careful in having their manuals of devotion correffly

thing, some inaccurate manuscript may betray them into pray-
i-ng for the quite contrary.

As to Britain, if learning had still some footing there in the
eighth century, it was so totally exterminated from thence in
the ninth ; that, throughout the whole kingdom of the West-‚
Saxons, no man could be found who was scholar enough to
instru& our King Affred, then a child, even in the first ele·
ments of reading ε so that he was in his twelfth year before ,he
could name the letters of the alphabet. When that renowned
Prince ascended the throne, he made it his study to draw hisi
people out of the ssoth and stupidity in which they lay ι and·
became, as much by his own example, as by the encouragement
he gave to learned men, the great restorer of arts in his dominions.
And here we are called upon to observe, that as Frjancehad
been formerly obliged to Englcznd in the person of Aleum,
who planted the sciences there under Charlemczgne3 our Issand
now received the same friendly afiistance from thence by
Grimbald, whom King Alfred had invited hither, and made
Chancellor of Oxford. Such Events as these are too confide—
rable, in the literary history of the ninth age, to be paffed
over unobserved. The rise of a noted grammarian, the voyage
of an applauded doctor, are recorded, by the chroniclers of that

century,
