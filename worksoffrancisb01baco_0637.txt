To THE MINT..

‘we saw no remedy but the execution of the laws, specially those of employ-
'nient being by some mitigation made agreeable to the times. And, these
s three remedies are of that nature, as they serve to remove the chuses of this
“scarcitffi There were other propofitions of policics and means, dircffly to
‘'draw filver to the Mint.
·’ ‘Tun fourth point thereos wasthis: It is agreed that the filver which harh
heretofore fed the Mint‚ principally bath been §panifh money. Thisnow
ssssscomes into the rcalm plentifully‚ but not into the Mint. lt was propound·
'fed in imitation of some precedent in mee, that his M'ajesty would hy pro-
*eiamation restrain the coming in of thismoney fitb modo, that is, that either
siit-‘be' brought to the Mint‚ or otherwise to be cut and defaced, because that
now it paffeth in payments in a kind of currcney. To which it was colour-
ably objectcd, that this would be the way to have none brought in at all, be-
(cause the gain ceafing, the importation would eease3 but this objeffion was
¹-wel'lanswered‚ that it is not gain altogether, but a neeessity of spcedy pax-
“ment, that causeth the merchant to bring in filver to keep his credit, and to
'iiiive his trade: so that if the King keep his fourteen days payment at the
” Mint, as he always hath done, and have lIkewise his exchangers for those
‘sinoneys in some principal parts, itis supposed that all Spanifh moneys, which
'ssfthe bulk of filver brought into this realm, would by means os such a procl-1-
'“ir'3'5tion come into the Minu which may be a thing considerable
ΤΗΕ fifth proposition was this: lt was warranted by the laws of Spain to
’ ,bri-‚ng 111 1ἶ1νε1· for corn or vieiua1s3 it was propounded that his Maicsty
² &ould restrain exportation of corn, ab modo, except they bring the filvcr
{which resulted thereof unto his Mim, that trade being commonly so beneti-
ssiiil, as the merchant may well endure the bringing of the filver to the Mint,
vy‘zilthOugh it were at the charge of coinage, which it now beareth further, as
'incident to this matter. There was revived by the 'merchants² with {bute
instance, the ancient proportion concerning the erefficin of granarics for
’ foreign corn, forasmuch as by that increase of trade in⁴ corn, the importa-
ffltion of filvcr would likewise be multiplied. >
y ’ JT HE sixth proposition was, That upon all licence of forbidden commodi-
τῖες, >there {hall be a rate set of filver to be brought into the Mint‚ which
friejx'rcrtheless may seem somewhat hard, because it imposeth upon the subject,
' th'at which causcth him to incur peril of- confiscation in foreign parts. To
''fiouble your Lordihips further with discourses whieh we had of making fo-
’1ςὲ1811 coins current, and of varying the King's standai-esto wcight‚ upon the
’1 variations in other states, aud repreffing surfeit of foreign commodtrtcs, that
o‘ur native commodities‚ surmounting the foreign, may draw 111 treasurc by
Way of overplus ς they be common places so well known to your Lotdsnips,
' ‘iss‘ it is enough to mention them only.
THERE is only one thing more, which is, to put your Lordlhipsin mind
, ’ὅῖ the extreme excess in the wasting ofboth metals both of gold and iilver
’ filiam, which turns the nature of these metals‚ which ought to be perdu-
table, and makes them perissiablc‚ and by consumption must be a principal
c‘ause of scarcity 111 them both3 which we conceive may receivea speedy
‘femedy by his Maiesty’s proclamation.

LAs TLY, WVe are humble suitors to your Lotdihips‚ th'at' for any of these
propositionS‚ that your Lotdlhips ffiould think fit to entertaiuin consultu-
tions, your Lordships would be pleased to hear them' debuted before your
selves, as being matters of greater weight than wc are able to judge of.
‘And so craving your Lordlhips pardon for troubling you so long, we com-
mend your Lordihips to God's goodncss.
