Ι ⁹9:142· thought also, that the invention of works and further pofiibilitv
was prejudiced in a more special manner than that of speculative truth}
for belides the impediments common to both, it hath by itself been notably
hart and discreditcd by the vain promises and pretences of alchcmy ma-
gick, astrology‚ and such other arrs, which (as they now pass) hold inuch

more of imagination and belief, than of sense and demonstration. But to*

use the poet'us language, men ought to have remembrcd, that alrhouoh Ixion
«οξ a clpud in the likeness of June begar Centaurs and Chinzaeras‚⁰yet Ju-
ptter also of the true Juno begar Vulcan and Hebe. Neither is it just to
deny credit to the greatness of the acts of Alexander, because the like or
more strange have been seigned of an Amadz's ot an Arthur‚ or other fabulous
worthies. But though this in truc reason should be, and that men ought not
to make a confusion of unbelief3 yet he saw well, it could not otherwise bc
in event, but that experiencc of untruth had made access to truth more dif-
fleuit,- and that the ignominy of vanity had abated all greatncss of mind.

naturally bred and fortified, and furthered by discourse and doetrinc, which
did pervcrt the true procecding towards aCtive aud operative knowledge.
This was a false estimation, that it lhould be as a diminution to the mind of
man-to be much conversant in experienees and particulam, subject to sense
md bcmnd in matter, and which arc laborious to search, ignoblc to medi-
tate, harlh to delivcr, illiberal to praetise, infinite as is supposed in number,
'find no ways accommodate to the glory of artS. This opinion or state of
mind received much credit and strength by the school of Plato, who think·
ing? that particulars rather revived the notions, or excited the facultics of the
mind, than merely informcd3 and having mingled his philosophy with su‘-
p'erstition, which never favoureth the sense, extolleth too much the under-
standing of man in the inward light thereof. And again, Aristotle's school,
which giveth the dew to the sense in affertion, denieth it in praeticc much
more than that of Plato. For we sec the schoolmen, Aristotle's succcss'ors,
which were utterly ignorant of history, restcd only upon agitation of wit3
whereas Plato giveth good example of inquiry by induction and view of par-
ticulars3 though in such a wandering manner as is of no force or fruit. So
that he saw well, that the supposition of the sufficiency of man's mind, hath
lost the means thereof.
