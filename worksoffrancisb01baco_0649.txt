OF NATURE.

worth of the effcds, butin the nature of the dii-estioii, for our par-*ose n: —
to stne up mens hopes, but to guide their travels. The tizlness Ofdrirffiim ri,

' work, and produce any effect, consisteri} in two conditions, certaintv and libert-2·

Certainty is, when the directionis not only truc for the moll part, but infallib‘ '.
Liberty1s‚ when the direfflon is not restrained to tome definite means· but cossi:
‚prehendeth all the means and ways pollibles sor the noct saith weil, Sz’zpientibu r

ἰε the greatest singularity of choice. Betides, as a eoiiiectnral directioiffniakcrh
acafiial effect, lo a particular and restrained direction is no less caliial than
uncertain. for those particular means whereunto it is tyed, may be out ¹of
{ome power, or may be accompanied with an overvalue of prciudice5 and
io if tor want of certainty in directim, you are frustrated in success for
want of variety in direction, you are stopped in attempt. lf therefore 'vous
,direstion be certain, it must refer you, and point you to somewhar, which
isat beprescnt‚ the estest you secl< willofnecessity follow, else mai: yon pes-
form and not obtaIn. If it be free, then must it refer you to lbi'newhar

which if tt bc ablent, the effect you secl< will of neceffity withdraw, else maxi
,you have power and not attempt. This notion Aristotle had in light, though

notin uie. ⁴ For the two commended rules by him set down, where-bv the

axioms of scxcnces are preceptcd to be made convertible, and which the latter
*men have not without elegancy surnamed3 the one the rulc oftruth, because

it preventeth deecit3 the other the rule othprudcncq because it freeth electiori,

[arethe same thing in speculation and a rmation, which we now observe.

An example will make my meaning attan-red, and yet percase make it thought
-that they attained it not. Let the effect to be produced be whiteness5 let ‘mc
tirst dii-cstion be, that if air and water be intermingled‚ or broken in small
portioris together, whitcncss will ensue3 as in snow, in the breaking of the
ways of the sea and rivers, and the like. This direction is certain, but s’ery par-
ticu ; and restrained, being tyed burto air and water. Lct the second dircffion
b ‚ that if air be mingled as before with any transparent body, such neverthcless-
as is uncoloured and more groflly transparent than air it self, that then, &a
as glass or crystal, being beaten to fine powdcr, by the interposition of the
air becometh white3 the white of an egg, being clear of it self, receivine, air
by agitation, becomerh white, receiving air by concoffion, becometh white;
here you are freed from water, and advaneed to a clear body, and still tyed
to air. Let the third direffion exclude or remove the restraint osan uncolour-
ed body, as in amber, saphires, &a which beaten to fine powdcr, become
white in wine and beer3 which brought to froth, become white. Let the
fourth direc'lion exclude the restraint of a body more grossly transparent than
air, as in flame, being a body compounded between air and a finer substance.
than air3 which flame, if it were not for the smoke, which is the third sub—
stance that incorporateth it self and dicth, the flame would be more perfect
white. In all these four directions air still beareth a part. Lct the fifth di·
-reffion then be, that if any bodies, both transparcnt, but in an unt-qual de-
gree, bc mingled as before, whiteness will follow: as oil and water beaten
to an ointment‚ though by settling, the air which gathcreth in the agitation
be evaporare, yet remaineth white-3 and the powder of glai} or crystal‚ pur
into water, whereby the air giveth place, yet remaineth white, though not
-so perfect. Now arc you freed from air, but still you arc tyed to transparent
bodies. To ascend further by scale ido forbear, partly because it would
draw o'n the example to an over-great length, but chiefly because it would
open that which in this work 1 determine to selei-ve: ἴοι· ro pass through the
