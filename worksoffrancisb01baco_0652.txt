OF THE INTERPRETATION

pointing you to nature that isunscparablc from the nature you enquire upon 5,
yet if it donor carry you on a degree or remove nea-rer to aetion, operation
or light, to make or produce, it is but superficial and counterfeit 5 where-fore
to secure and warrant what is atruc arrectiora, though that general notel'=
have given be perspicuous in it self, (for a man ffiall soon eas-‘t with himself
whether he be ever the near to effe& and operate or no, or whether he have
won but an abstrast or varied notiori) yet for better instruffion, 1 will deliver-
three particular notes of cantion. The first is, that the nature discovered be
more original than the nature supposed, and not more seconciary, or of the
'like dcgrce3 as to make a stone bright, or to make it smooth‚ it is a good
dircfflon to say, make it even 3 but to make a stone even, *it rs no good dirce-
tion to say, make it bright‚ or make it smooth : for the rule ir, that the dis-
position of any thing referring to the state of it in it sels, or the parts, is more
original than that which is relative or transitive towards another thing.

So evenncss is the dispofition of the stone in it sclf, but smooth is rothe
hand and bright to the eyc, and yet neverthelcss they all clusser and concur ς
and yet the direction is more unperfest, if it do appoint you to such a rela-
tive, as is in the same kind, and not in a diverse. For in the direction, to
produce brightness by smoothncss, although properly it win no degree, and
will never teach you any new particulars before unknown, yet by way of
suggestion, or bringing to mind, it may dtaw your consideration to some
particulars known but not remcmbred ,ς as you shall sooner remembcr some
prastieal means of making smoothness‚ than if you had fixed your conside-
ration. only upon brightncsss but if the direction had been to make bright-
nesS, by making reflexion as thus, make it such as you may sec your face in
it3 this {smerely secondary‚ and helpcth neither by way of infomfing, nor
by way of suggesting. So if in the enquiry of whitcness you were directed
to make such a colour as should be scen furthest in a dark light ς here you are
advanccd nothing at all. For these kinds of naturcs are but proprieties,
est'ccts, circumstances, concnrrenccS, or what else you will like to call them,
and not radical and formative natures towards the nature supposed. The se-
cond cantion is, that the nature inquired be collected by division before

composition, or to speak more properly by composition subaltern, before
you ascend to composition absolute, &a

UT yct nevetthcless here 1 may be mistakcn, by reason of some which
have much in their pen the referring scienccs to acuon and the use of

man, which mean quite another matter than 1 do. For they mean a con-
triving of directions, and precepts for readiness of praefice, which 1 discom-
mend not, soit be not occasion that some quantity of the science be10st3 for
else it will be such a piece of husbandry, as to put away a mann-or lying
somewhat scanned, to buy in a close that lieth handsomely about a dwel-
