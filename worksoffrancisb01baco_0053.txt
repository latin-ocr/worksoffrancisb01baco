LORD CHANCELLOR 'BAcoixz xxxi

perfisted for seven years together; against his own interest, against
the universal voice of his people: only to procure the imaginary
honour of an alliance with a crowned head ; for all other alliances
he thought below his dignity. Sir Francis Baton who saw thro the Paron Vol·
vanity and danger of this intention, but who wanted resolution iiiii&
to be greatly honest, contented himself with infinuating softly,
that it would be neceffary to have the council unanimous in their
fuffrage on the occasion, whatever might be their private senti-

the contrary, he run blindfold into the snare that Gm7damor was

payment discharge the whole debt due to the crown of Englmzd.
This stratagern took effect. James wrote to the States ; and
the matter was immediately put into negotiation. The pen-
fionary Bar-mvelt, whom they sent over, conducted the affair
with so much address, that the King agreed to deliver up the
cautionary towns for less than three millions of florius, in lieu
