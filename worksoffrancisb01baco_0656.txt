oF THE INTERPRETATION

grossly managed at first, by time accommodate and refined. The philoso» ¹,
phies and sciences of Aristode, Plato, Democritus, Hippocrates, of m 0st
vigout at first, by time degenerated and imbased In the former man}- wita

and industries contributed 111 one. 111 the latter many mens wits 1ρ6111 tor Ἴ

THE error is both 1n the dcliv 6161 and m the receiver. He that deliverem ’
knowledge, defireth} to deliver it in such form as may be sooness believed,
and not 33 may eassliest 06 examined. Hc that receiv eth know led ἶ;,6 defireth
rather present satisfaction than expectant search and so rather not to doubt
than not to er.r Glory maketh the author not to lay open his wcaknels:
and ssoth maketh the disciple not to know his strength.

THEN begin men to alpire to the second prizes, to be a profound inter·
preter and commenter‚ to be 3 ssiarp champion and defendet, to be a 11161119-
dieal eompounder 3ηά abridger. And this is the unfortunate succcssion of
wits which the world harh yet had, whereby the patrimony of all know-
ledge goeth not on husbanded or improved, but wastccs and decayed.·1='<ir
knowledge is li ke a water that will never arise again higher than the level
f·-10m which it fell. And therefore to go beyond Aristotle by the light tf
Aristotle, is to think that 3 horrowed light can increase the 01111131 hg&
from whom 1t is taken. So then, no true Diucceffion. of w its having been m
the world; either we must conclude, that knowledge 13 buta tasko for one
man's life, and then vain was the complaint, that life is fhort, and art is
long .· or else, that the knowledge that now is, is but a 1111110· and n'ot that
trce which 18 never danger,ous but where· 1t is to the purpose of knowing
good and ev il3 which desire ev er riseth upon an appetite 10616ἂ,311ἀ not to
obey, and so containeth m it a manifest defection. ·

ssiat the pretendeclsucccffion of wits bath been evil placed, sor-03*
much as after variety ofsecfls and opinions, the most popular
and not the truest prevaileth and weareth out the rest3 being
the 7th chapter, a fragment.

T is senfible. to think, that when men enter first into search and-enquiry5
according to the several frames 3ηά compositionis of their understanding‘,
they light upon differing 601166113, and so all opinions and doubts· are bea*
ten ovem and then men having made a taste of all, wax weary of variety,
and so 161661 1116 worst, and hold themselves ro the best, either some one if it
be eminent3 or some two or three, if they be in some equality 3 which after·-
wards are received and carried on, and the rest extinc‘t. ·
Βυ r troth is contrary ς and that time is like a river, which carrieth down
things which are light and blown up, and finketh and drowneth that which is
fild and weighty. For howsoever gorcrnments have several 10111131οω6-
times one governing, sometimes few, sometimes the multitude3 yet the
state of knowledge is ever a democraty‚ and that prcvaileth which is most
agreeable to the tenses and conceirs of pcoplc. As for example, there is nor
great doubt, but he that did put the beginnings of things to be solid, void,
and motion to the center, was in better earnest than he thar put matter, form
’.1ηά lhifr, or he that put the mind, motion and matter. For no man shall
enter into inquisition of nature, but {hall pass by that opinion ofDemocritus5
