To THE

READER.

T H E present Edition of my Lord Bacon’s Works contains

all the pieces of that great man, which are, we believe,

any where extant. And we hope it will be found the
most accurate and elegant, as well as the only complete one,
that has been hitherto offered to the public.

THE additional pieces, and many Letters not inserted in the
last Edition, and some never before published ; as also several
of the Law-Trac‘ts, are printed from the original Manuscripts
communicated by the Right Honourable the Earl of Oxforcl ;
all which have been carefully collated by the reverend and
learned Mr. T Birch.

THE law—trae& which in all other Editions were so incor-
re& as to be often unintelligible, have been revised by a Gentle—
man of that profeffion ε the alterations made are either founded
on the authority of Manuscripts, or such as the sense neceffarily
re mres.

ΕΙΙΤ was found neceffary to change the dispolition of the
whole fourth volume: and the letters are digested into a regu-

lar series of time.
To the whole is prefixed a new Life of the Author 3 com-

posed entirely from authentic vouchers: but with what judg-
ment and spirit, the public alone has a right to determine.
