Α, B'u'r yet evermore lt must be remembred, that the 102st pm of know.
ledge pass'ed to man by ¹this so largea charter from God, must be subject to
that use for which God hath granted it, which is rhe bencfit and relief of the
state and society o‘f man3 for otherwise all manner of knowledge becomcth
malign and serpentine, and therefore as carrying the quality of the serpent's·
sting and mallee, it maketh the mind of man to swell 3 as the scripture saith
excellently‚ Knowledge bloweth up, but charity buildeth up. And again,
the Came author doth notably disavow both power and knowledge, suElx as
is-not dedicated to goodness or loves for saith he, If] have ἆίί saith fi’
as] could remove mountains (there is power affive) if I render my body to
the fire (there is power pafli ve) iflspeak with the tongues of men and an-
gels, (there is knowledge, for langnage is but the convcyance of knowlcdoe)
allvwere nothing. Ο
uAND therefore it is not the pleasurc of euriofity, nor the quiet of resolu-
tion, *nor the raising of the spirit, nor victory of wit,- nor faculty of speech,
nor luere of profession, nor ambition of honour or fame, or inablement for
Ι business, that are the true ends of knowledge; some of these being more
wbrthy than other, though all inferior and degenerare: but iris arestitution
and reinvesting (in great part) of man to the sovereignty and power, (for
whensoevcr he {hall be able to call the creatures by their true names, he {hall
again command them) which he had in his first state of creatiou. And to
speak plainly and clearly, it isa discovery of all operations and possibilitics of
operations from immortality (if it were poffible) to the meanest mechanical
prastice. And therefore knowledge, 'that tendeth but to stitisfiielion, is but
as aeourtisan, whichis· fot pleasure and not for fruit or generation. And
kuowledge that tendeth to profit or profeffion, or glory, is bnt as the gol-
« den ball thrown before Atalanten which while she goeth afide, and stoop·
eth to take up, {he hindreth the raee. And knowledge referred to some
particular point of use, is but as Harmodius, which putteth down one ty-
rant z and not like Hercules, who did perambulate the world to supprcss
vtyrants and giants and monstcrs in every part.
- Iris true, that in two points the curse is peremprmy, and not to bc re-
moved: the one, that vanity must be the end in all human effects3 eternity
being resumed‚ though the revolutions and periods may be delayed. The
other, that the consent of the creature being now turned into reluehtion, this
power cannot otherwise be exercised and administrcd but with labour, as well
in inventing as in executing ; yet nevertheless chiefly that labour and travel,
which is described by the sweat of the brows, more than of the body ς that
is, such travcl as is joined with the working and discursion ofthe spirits in
the brain: for as Solamen saith excellently, The fool putteth to more
strength, but the wifi’man confidereth which way,- signifying the election
of the mean to be more material than the multiplicatiori of endeavour. lt
is true also, that there is a limitation rather potential than astual, which is
when the effe& is poffible, but the time or place yieldeth not the matter or
basts whereupon man should work. But notwithstanding these precinas
and bounds, let it be believed, and appeal ther-eof made to time, (with rc-
nunciation neverthelcss to all the vain and abusmg promises of Alchemg‘lt’s
and Magiclans, and such like light, idle, ignorant, credulous and fantasti-
cal wits and fests) that the new-found world of land was no’t greater addition
to the ancient continent, than there remaineth at this day a world ofinven-
tions and scicuees unknown, having respect to those that are known, wilth
