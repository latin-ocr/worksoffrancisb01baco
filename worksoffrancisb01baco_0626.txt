CERTIFICATE Tovem-NG

THE sixth consideration is likewise of an objectiom which is matter of
practice, viz. that from R. H's time to Q Illary, which is almost 200 years,
there was an intermiflion of impositious, as appe-areth both by tecords and

the custom-books.
To which Ι answer3. both that we hare in effe& an equal number of .

years to countetvail thern, mmely‚ 100 years in the times ofrhe three Kings
Edwards added to 60 of our last year-53 and extrema obruunt media ‚- for
we have both the rcverence of antiquity and the poss'esslon ofthe present tImes,
and they but the middle timcs3 and besides, in all true judgmcnt there is a
very great difference between an usage to prove a thing lawfist, and a non-
usage to prove it unlawful ε for the practice plainly implieth consents but
the discontinuance may be either because it was not needful, though lawfuh
or because there was found a better means, as 1 think it was indeed in respect
of the double customs by means of the staple at Calais.

A Certificate to his Majesty, touching the projths of ’
Sir ST EPHE N PRO c T oR, relating to the Pe-
nal Laws,

It may pleaseyourfizcred IlIajesty, Ι
lTH' the first free time from your Maiesty's service of more present
ῳ K) dispatch‚ 1 have pcrused the projcc‘is of Sir Stephen Ῥνθέῖον, and
do find it a collection of extreme diligence and inquisition, and
more than Ithought could have met in one man's knowledge. For though
it be an easy matter to run over many offices and professions, and to note in
them general abuses or deceits; yet neverthcless to point at and traceyout
the particular and covert practices, lhists, denses, tricks, and as it were stra·
tagems in the meaner sort of the ministers of justice or publick service& and
to do it truly and understandingly‚ is a discovery whercof great good ‘use
may be made for your Majesty’s service and good of your pcoplel But be-
cause this wotkl doubt not hath been to the gentleman the work of years,
whereas my certificate must be the work but of hom-s ot days, and that it is
commonly and truly said, that he that imbtaccth much, straineth and hold-
eth the less, and that propositions have wings, but operation and execution
hath lenden feet3 l most humbly desire pardon ofyour Maiesty‚ if1 do for
the present only select some one or two principal pointS, and certify my opi-
nion thereof5 reserving the rest as a sheaf by me to draw out at further time
further matter for your Majcsty’s information fot so much as 1 {hall conceive

to be fit or worthy the confidet-arion.

1²01< that part therefore of these proiects which concerneth penal laws,
1 do find the purpose and scope to be, not to press a greater rigor or severity
in the execution of penal laws3 but to repress the abuscs in common infor-
mers and some clerks and undet>ministcrs that for common gain partake
with them: for ifit had tended to the other point, 1 sor my part should be
very far from adviling your Maiesty to give car unto it.· For as it is said iu
the Psalmi, If thou Lord should be extreme to mark what is done amfi,
who mar abide it ? So it is most certain, that your people is so ensnared in
a multitude of penul laws, that the execution ofthem cannot be borne. And
as it followcth3 But with thee 1'5 mercy, that thou mayest befeared .· so it
