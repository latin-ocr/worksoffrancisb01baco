OF THE INTERP'RET‘ATION'.

Of the internal and profound errors and superstitions in the

nature of the mind, and of- the four sorts of idols or fiflions
which offer themselves to the understanding in the inqu{fition
of knowledge3 being the 1 6th chapter, and this a small frag-

ment thereof, being a preface to the inward elenches of the
mind. ·

HE opinion of Epicurus, that the Gods were of human ffiape, was
rather justly derided than serioussy confuted by the other sedis, de-
manding whether every kind of sensible creatures did not think their own fi-
gure fairest, as the horse, the bull, and the like, which found no beauty but
in their own forms, asin appetite of lust appeared. And the heresy of the
Anthropomorphites was ever censured for a gross conceit, bred in the obscure
cells of solitary monks that never looked abroad. Again, the fable so well
known of Qn's pinxit leonem, doth set forth well, that there is an error of
pride and partiality, as well as of custom and familiarity. The reflexion also
from glafl'es so usually resembled to the imagery of the mind, every man
knoweth to receive error and variety both in colour, magnitude and shape,
according to the quality of the glass. But yet no use hath been made of thefiz
and many the like observations to move men to search out, and upon search
to give true cautious of the native and inherent errors in the mind of man,
which have coloured and corrupted all his notions and impressions. ,
Ido find therefore in this inehanted glass four idols‚ or false appearanccs
of several and distinct forts, every sort comprehcnding many subdivisions:
the first sort, I call idols of the nation or tribe 3 the second, idols of the] pa-
lace 3 the third, idols of the cave ς and the fourth, idols of the theatre, &a

Of the irtghedirnents of knowledge 3 being the 4th chapter, the
preface only of it.

N some things it is more hard to attempt than to archieve 3 which falleth
I out, when the difficulty is not so much iu the matter or subject, as itis
in the croffness and indisposstion of the mind of man to think of any such
thing, to will or to resolve it; and therefore Titus Livius in his declama-
tory digression, wherein he doth depr-ess and extenuate the honour of Ale-
xander’s conquests, saith, Nihil aliud quam bene aufhs vana contemnere .-
in which sort of things it is the manner of men first to wonder that any such
thing should bc poffible, and after it is found out, to wonder again how the

world lhould missit so long. Of this nature, 1 take to be the invention and
discovery of knowledge, &a

The impediments which have been in the times, and in diverfion

of wits 3 being the 5th chapter, a small fragment in the be-
ginning of that chapter.

HE incounters of the times have been nothing favourablc and prospe-
rous for the invention of knowledge, so as it is not only the dainti-
ness of the seed to take, and the ill mixture and unlikiug of the ground ro
