‘nouristi or raise this plant, but the ill scason also of the xvc-ather, by which ii
bath been cheeked and blasted. Especially in that the seasons have* been pro·
per to bring up and set forward other more hasty and indifferent plants,
whercby this of knowledge hath been starved and overgrown3 for in the
descent of times always there harh been somewhat else in reign and reputa—
tion, which hath generally aliened and diverted wits and labours from that
employmcnt.

Fon as for the uttermost antiquity‚ which is like fame that muffics her
head, and tells tales, 1 cannot presume much of it3 for I would not willine-
ly imitate the manner of those that describe maps, which when they come too
some far countrieS, whereof they have no knowledge, set down how there
b‘e‘oreat wastes and desarts there : so I am not apt to affirm that they knew
fflt‘ e, because what they knew is little known to us, Butif you will judae
'⁹6⁴5' them by the last traces that remain to uS, you will conclude, though υἷε
ζίὸἦῑεὸῑηῑηῌγ as Aristotle doth, that saith our ancestors werc extreme gross,
as⁴tliose that come newly from being moulded out of the clay, or some
Qfflssy substance, yet reasonably and probably thus, that it was with them

J‘r'riatter of knowledge, but as the dawning or break of day. For at that
*f the *the world was altogether home-bred, every nation lookcd little be-
yond their own confines or territories ‚ and the world had no thorough lights
thien, as it hath had fince by commerce and navigation, whercby there
dould neither be that contribution of wits one to help another, nor that
‘variety of particulars for the co'rreffing the customary conccits.

”’ Am> as there could be no g'reat collection of wits of several parts or na-
ricus, so neither could there be any succeffion of wits of several times,-
whereby one might refine the other, in regard they had not history to any
purpose. And the manner of their traditions was utterly unfit and unpro-
per for amplification of knowledge. And again, the studies of those times
you stiallfind, besides wars, incursions and rapines, which were then almost
every where betwixt states adioining (the use of leugues and confederacics be-
·i'ng not then known) were to populate by multitude of wives and generation,
a thing at this day in the waster part of the ltzst-Indtes principally affected ς’
and to build, sometimes for habitation towns and cities, sometimes for fame
and memory monumentS, pyramids, coloss'es, and the like. And if there
happened to rise up any more civil wits; then would he found and creet
some new laws, customs and usages, such as now of late years, when the
world was revolute almost to the like rudeness and obscurity, we see both in
our own nation and abroad many examples of, as well in a number of te-
nures reserved upon mcn's lancis, as in divers customs of towns and man-
nors, being the devises that such wits wroughtv upon in such times of deep

ignorance, &a

{Ibe impediments of knowledge for want of a true sttcceffi‘on of
wits‚ and that hitherto the length of one man's life hath bem
p the greatest measure of knowledge3 being the 6th chapter, the
