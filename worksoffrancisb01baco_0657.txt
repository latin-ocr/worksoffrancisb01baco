OF NATURE.

whereas hc {hall never come near the other two opinionS‚ but leave them
aloof, for the schools and table-talk. Yet those of Artssotle and Plato, be-
cause they be both agreeable to popular sense, and the one was uttered with
,subtilty and the spirit of contradiction, ancl the other with a style of orna-
ment and majesty, did hold out, and the other gave place, &a

CICERO the orator, willing to magnify his own profefflon, and therc-

. 2 , ,upon spending many words to maintain that eloquence was not a lhop of
good words and elegancics, but a treasury and receipt os all knowledges, so

‚far forth as may appettain to the handling and moving ofthe minds and af-

zfeozions of men by speech3 maketh great complaint of the school of So-
crates 3 that whereas before his time the fame profess'ors of wisdom in Gree-ce
dd pretend to teaeh an universal sapience and knowledge both of matter and
words, Socrates divorced them, and withdrew philosophy, and left rheto-

‹tickfto it self, which by that dest1tution became but a barren and. unnoble
science. And in particular sciences we sce, that if men fall to subdivide their

[labourg as to be an oculist in physick‚ or to be perse& in some one title ofthe
,law or the like, they may prove ready and subtile, but not deep or sufficient,
no not in that subject which they do particularly attend, because of that con—
sent which it hath with the rest. And it is a matter of common discourse,

of the chain of sciences, how they are linked together, in so much as the
Grecians, who had terms at will, have fitted it of a name of Circle Learn-

ing. Nevertheless 1 that hold it for a great impediment towards the advanee-
2ment and further invention of knowledge, that particular arts and seicnces
-have been disincorporated from general knowledge, do not understand one
,and the same thing, which Cicero’s discourse‚ and the note and conceit of
*the Grecians in their word Circle Learning do intend. For 1 mean not
that use which one science harh of another for ornament or help in praefice,
as the orator hath of knowledge of affections for moving, or as military

:science may have use of geometry for fortifications ; but 1 mean it direstly of
.that use by way of supply of light and infor-marion, which the particulars
and. instances of one scienee do yield and present for the framing or correct-

:ing of the axioms of another science in their very truth and notion. And
therefore that example of oculists and title lawyers doth come nearer my con-
-ceit than the other two3 for scienees distinguished have a dependance upon
,universal knowledge to be augmentcd and rcfflfied by the superior light
,thereof5 as well as the parts and members of a seience have upon the maxims
,of the same sciencc, and the mutual light and consent which one part receiv-
eth of another. And therefore the opinion of Capernicus in astronomy,
. which astronomy it self cannot correct, because it is not repugnant to any of
she appearances 3 yet natural philosophy doth correst. On the other side, it'
some of the ancient philosophers had been perfect in the observations of asti-o-

nomy, and had called them to connscl when they made their principles and
first axioms, they would never have divided their philosophy, as the (30ιίυο-
