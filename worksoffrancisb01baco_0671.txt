find in any scripture, that the inquiry and sciencc of man iu any 1111110, under
the rhysteries of the deity, is determined and restrained, but contrariwise 111-
lowed and provoked. For concerning all 011101· knowledge, the scripture
pronounceth, That it is the glory of God to conceal, lmt it is the glory of*
man (or of the King, for the King is but the excellency os 111311) to {nve'nt‘}

Δ and again, T he spirit of man is as the lamp of G'ocl, etherewl'th he starch- ,

eth every ficret ς ancl again most effedually, That God hath made all
'things beautiful and decent, according to the return ofthez'rfiasbns ,- al-
sbssrthat he hathset the world in man’s beart, and yet man cannot find out
the work which God worketh from the beginning to the end .· ihewint:
11131 the heart of man is a continent of that concave 01· capacity, where-in the
content of the world (11131 is, all forms of the creatures, and whatsoever is
not. (jod) may be placed, or received; and complaining, that through the
variety os things, and vicifiitudes of times, (which are but impediments
aud not impuifl'ances) man cannot accomplilh his invention. In precedent
aises he set before his eyes, that in those few memorials before the flood, the
scripture honoureth the name of the inventor-s of munci< 31111 works in 1110-
, tulis-that Moffis had this addition of praise, that he was seen in all the 103111-
img-of the Egyptians3 that Salomon, in his grant of wisdom from God‚
hndwntaincd as a braneh thereos that knowledge, whereby he wrote a 113-
1111311 history of all verdor, from the cedar to the moss, 31111 of all 11131
bteatheth3 that the book of Job, 31111 many places of the prophets, have
greatJaspei-fion of natural philosophy 3 that the ehureh in the bosom and lap
thereos in the greatest iniuries of times, ever preserved (as holy reliques) the
books of philosophy and all heathen learning3 31111 11131 when Gregory the
bilhop of Rome became adverse and unjust to the memory of 1103111011 anti-
quity, it was censured for pusillanimity in him, and the honour ther-eof
soon after restored, and his own memory almost persecuted by his succcss'or
Sabinian3 and lastly, 111 our times, and the ages of our fathers, when
Luther and the divines of the protestant ehureh on the one side, and the
jesuits 011 1110 011101, 113νο euterprized 10 reform, the one the 1106111110, 1110
other the discipline and manners of the church of Rome, he saw well how
both of them have awaked to their great honour and succour 311 1111111311 103111-
ing; and for reason, there cannot be 3 greater and more evident than this,
that all knowledge, and specially 11131 of natural philosophy, tendeth highly
to the magnifying of the glory of God 111 his power, providence and benefits,
appearing and engraven in his works, which without this knowledge 310 be-
held but as through a vcil : for if the heavens in the body of them do 11001310
the glory of God to the eye, much more do they in the rule and dcerees of
them 11001310 it to the understanding. And another reason, not inferior to
this, is, 11131 the 111 1110 natural philosophy principally amongst 311 other 1111111311
knowledge, doth give 311 excellent defencc against both extremes of religion,
superstition and infidelitys for both it frceth the mind from 3 number or*
weak fancies and imaginations, and it raiserh the mind to acknowledge 11131
to God all things are poffiblc: for to 11131 purpose speaketh our SaviOur 111
that first canon against herefies, delivered upon the case 01111010111110111011,
Yon err, nat knowing the fieriptures, nor the power ofGocl5 reaching,
that there are but two fountains of heresy, not knowing the will of God re-
vealed 111 1110 scriptur-es, and not knowiug the power os God revealed or at
least made most sensible in his creatures. So as he siw well, that natural

philosophy was of excellent use to the exaltatior] of the divine Maicsty 3 alm
