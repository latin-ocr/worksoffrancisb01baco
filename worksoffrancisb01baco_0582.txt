NOTES OF A SPEECH CONCERNING·

divers of the Princes of Germany and others. As for the comparison of
Spain as it was then, and as it is now, you will for good respects for-
bear to speak; only you will say this, that Spain was then reputed to have

the wisest council of Europe, and not a council that will come at the whistle Α

of a favourite.

ANoTHER point of expetience you would „not speak of, ifit were not
that there is a wonderful erroneons observation, which walketh about, con-
trary to all the true account of time3 and it is, that the Spaniard where
he once gets in, will seldom or never be got out again, (and they give it an
ill-favoured stmile which you will not name) but nothing is lcss true: they
got footing at Brest, and some other parts in Britain, and quitted it : they
had Calais, Ardes, Amans, and were part beaten out, and part they ren-
dred: they had Vercelles in Savoy ancl fairly left it: they had the other
day the Valtoline, and now have put it in deposite. What they will do
at Ormus we shall see. So that to speak truly of later times, they have ra—
ther poached and offered at a number of enterprize5‚ than maintained any
constantly. And for Germany, in more ancient time, their great Emperor
Chat-les after he had Germany almost in his fist, was forced in the end to go
from Isbztrgh as it were in a mask by torch-light, and to quit every foot
of his new acquests in Germany, which you hope likewise will be the here-
ditat-y iffue of this late purchase of the Palatinate. And thus much for
experience.

F OR reason. It hath many branehes; you will but extra& a few first. It
is a nation thin sown of men, partly by reason of the sterility of their soil;
and partly because their natives are exhaust by so many imployments in such
vast territories as they possess, so that it hath been counted a kind of miracle
to see together ten or twelve thousand native Spaniards in an army. And
although they have at this time great numbers of miseellany soldiers in their
armies and garrisonS, yet if there should be the misfortune of a battle, they
are ever long about it to draw on supplies.

THEY tell a tale of a Spantfh ambassador that was brought to see their
treasury of S t. lilark at Venice, and still he looked down to the ground3 and
being asked the reason, said, He was looking to ste whether the treafitre
had any root, so that tf that were spent, it wouldgrow again as his master’s
had. But howsoever it be of their treasure, certainly their forces have scarcely
any root, or at least such a root as puttcth forth very poorly and ssowly;
whereas there is notin the world again such a spring and seminary of military
people as is England, scotland, and Ireland‚- nor of scarnen as is this issand,
and the Low Conntries: so as if the wats should mow them down, yet they
suddenly may be supplied and come up again.

A second reason is (and it is the principal) that if we truely confidet the
greatness of Spain, it confisteth chiefly in their treasure, and their treasure in
their Iudas, and their Indies (both of them) is but an access'lon to such as
are masters by sea3 so as this axle—tree whereupon their greatness turns, is soon
cut a-two by any that {hall be stronger than they at sea. So then you report
your sclf to their opinions, and the opinions of all men, enemies or who·
soevers whether that the maritime forces of Britain, and the Low Countries,
are not able to beat them at sea. For if that be, you see the chain is broken
from stripping to Indies, from Indies to treasure, and from treasure to
greatness.
