LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. lvii

minable. ¹ He tells us, that there were but four persons then in
Europe who had made any progress in the Mathematics3 and
in Chimistry yet fewer: that those who undertook to transsate
Aristode were every way unequal to the task: and that his wri-
nugs, which, rightly understood, Bacon confidered as the foun-
t'ain of all knowledge, had been lately condemned and burned,
in a synod held at Paris.

THE works of that celebrated Antient have, in truth, more
exercised the hatred and admiration of mankind than those of
all the other philosophers together. Lazw my enumerates no less [ὼ ff,
‘than thirty— seven Fathers of the Church who have stigmatized {³⁸ss ΞἸΠΙἻ,
his name, and endeavoured to reprobate his dofftrines Moahoff Ι Ι ,ΙΙΙ ΙΙΙΟΙ,
has reckoned up a still greater number of his commentator-s ,
who were at the same time implicitely his disciples: and yet
both these authors are far from having given a complete list ei-
ther of his friends or enemies. In his life—time he was suspeeted
of irreligion‚ and, by the Pagan priesthood, marked out for
destruction: the succeffors of those very men were his partizans
and admirers‚ His works met with much the same treatment
‘from the Christian clergy: sometimes proscribed for heretica13
sometimes triumphant and acknowledged the great bulwark of
Orthodoxy. Lamzoy has written a particular treatise on the
subjeet‚ and mentioned eight different revolutions in the for-
tune and reputation of Arstotle's philosophy. To pass over the
intermediate changes, Ι will just mention tvm, that make a full
and ridiculous contrast. In the above— mentioned Council held
at Pam's about the year 1209, the Bishops there censured his Ι bi
writingS, without discrimination‚ as the pestilent sources of error su [[[Νὲ
and hercsy3 condemned them to the flunes, and commanded
all persons, on pain of excommunication, not to read, tran-
·scribe, or keep any copies of them. They went farther‚ and
'delivered- over to the secular arm no less than ten persons, who
were burned alive, sor certain tenets, drawn, as those learned
prelates had heard, from the pernicious books in question. ,In
the fixteenth century, those very books were not only read with
impunity, but every where taught with applause: and whoever
disputed their orthodoxy, I had. almost said their infallibility,
was persecuted as an infidel and iniscreant. Of this the so—
phister Ramns is a memorable instance. Certain animadver-

:lions of his on the peripatetic philosophy occasioned a general
Vo L. Ι. ’ p ⁷ commotion
