Of the State of ΕΗΒ o PE,

IN* the consideration of the present state of Christendom, depending on
the inclinations and qualities of the princeS, governors of the same: first
*the person of the Pope, acknowledged for supreme of the princes catho-
lick, may be brought forth.

'GR E'Go RY ΧΙΙΙ. of the age of seventy years, by surname Boncompagno‚ eope}

born in Bolonia of the meanest state of the people; his father a Ihoemaker by
ἵ occupation, of no great learning nor understanding, busy rather in practice,
= than desirous of Ναὶ-3, and that rather to further the advanccment of his son
an'd his house (a respc& highly regarded of all the Popes) than of any incli-
nation of nature, the which yet in these years abhorre-th not his secret plea-
sures. Howbeit, two things especially have s et so lharp edge to him, where-
by he doth bend himself so vehemently against religion. The one is a mere
neceffity‚ the other the solicitation of the King of Spain. For if we confider
d'ul'y the estate of the present time, we {hall find that he is not so much carried
w‘ith the delire to suppress our religion, as driven with the fcar of the down-
fall of his own, if in time it be not upheld and restored.

THE reasons be these; he seeth the King of Spain already in years, and
worn with labour and troubles, that there is little hope in him of long life.
And he faiHng, there were likely to ensue great alterations of state in a'lhis
dominions‚ the which should be joined With the like in religion, especially
in this dlvided time, and in Spain already so for-ward, as the fury of the in-
quifition can scarce keep in. ’

ΙΝ France, the state of that church seemeth to depend on the sole life of
the King now teigning, being of a weak constitution full of infirmities, not
likely to have long life, and quite out of hope of any iffue. Of the Duke'
of Anjou hc doth not affure himself, besides the opinion conceived of the
Weakness of thc complexion of :ill that racc, glving neither hope of length
of life nor of children. And the next to the succession make already ro-
feffion of religion, besides the increase thei-eof daily in France; Enand
and Scotland are already, God be thanked, quite reformed, with the better
pfart 0‘f Germany. And because the Queen's Maiesty bath that reputation to'
be the defendet of the true religion and fairh, against her MaJcsty‚ as the head
of the faithful, is the drift of all their mischiefs.

' THE KIng of Spain having crected in his conceit a monarchy, wherein
secking reputation in the protestion of religion, this conjunfflon with the
Pope is as necessary to him for the further-nnec of his purposcS, as to the Pope
behoveful for the advancing ofhis house and for his authority3 the King of
Spain having already bestowed on the Pope’s son, degree of title and of office,
with grear revenues. To encourage the Pope hereIn, being head of the chureh,
th‘ey set before him the analogy of the name Gregon, saying that we were first*
under a Gregory brought to the saith, and by a Gregory are again to bc re-
duced to the obediencc of Rome.

A prophccy likewise is found out that foretelleth, the dragon sitting in the
chait of Peter, great things lhould be brought to pass. THUS
