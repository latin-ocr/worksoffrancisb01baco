OF ,NATURE

sarred to revelation and intelligence with spirits and h’gher natures. 'sliat
osrhose that have entrcd into search, some having fallen upon some conceits,
which- they after confidet to be the same which they have found in former
authors, have suddenly taken a persuafion that a man shall (but with much
lahout) incur and light upon the same inventions which he might with ease
,receive from others, and that it is but a vaniry and self-pleasing of the wit to
go about again, as one that would rather have a flower of his own gathering,
than much better gathercd to his hand. That the same humour of ssoth and
,diffidence suggesteth, that a man {hall but revivc some ancient opinion which
‘was long ago propounded, examined and rejected. And that it is easy to
err, in conceit, that a man's observation or notion is the same with a former
opinion, both because new conceits must of necessity be uttered in old words,
, aad· because upon true and erroneous grounds men may meet in consequence
dt-ssonelufion‚ as several lines οἱ· circles that cut in some one point. That
,theagreatest pai-t of those that have descended into search, have chosen for the
smst artificial and compendious course, to induce principles out of parti·
tuleras and to reduce all other propositions unto principlesi and so instead of
„thenearest way, have been led to no way, or a meer labyrinth. That the
„two-contemplative ways have some resemblance with the old parable of the
„two moral wayS, the one beginning withincertainty and difficulty, and end-
,λῇς in plainness and certaiury3 and the other beginning with shew of plain-
μηβὲ and certainty, and ending in difficulty and ineertainty. Of the great
,31ιά manifest error and untrue conceit or estimatidn of the infinitencss· of par-
¹tittulars, whereas indeed all prolixity is in discourse and derivations: and of
the-infinite and most laborious expence of wit that harh been employed upon
toys and matters of no fruit or value. That although the period of one age
cannot advance men to the furt‘hest point of interpretation of nature (except
the work should be undertaken with greater helps than can be expected) yet
it cannot fail in much less space of time to make return of many singular
commodities towards the state and occasions of man's life. That there is less
reason of distrust in the course of interpretation now proponnded, than in
any knowledge formerly delivered, because this course doth in sort equa! mens
wits‚ and leaverh no great advantage or preheminence to the perse& and ex-
cellent motions of the spirit. That to draw a streight line, or to make a circle
perfecit round by aim of hand only, there must be a great differencc between
“· an unsteady and unpraCtised hand, and a steady and praCtised3 but to doit by
rule or compass, it is much alike.

F the impediments which have been in the affection of pride,- specially

of one kind, which is the disdain of dwelling and being conversant

much in cxperiences and particulars, especially such as are vulgar in occurrency3

and base and ignoble in use. That befides certain higher mysterics of pride, ge-

neralities seem to have a dignity and solemnity, in that they do not put men in

mind of their familiar acii-ons, in thar they have less affinity with arts mechanicae}
