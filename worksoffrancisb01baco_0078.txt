‘THE LIFE oF THE
'party-nameS, which are now as little known or mentioned as
the controverfies that once occasioned them. It· is sufficient to
say, that, like all other parties, they hated each other heartily;
treated each other as heretics in logie: and that their disputes
were often ffiarp and bloody3 ending not only in the meta-
phorical destruction of common sense and language, but in the
real mutilation and death of the combatants. For, to the dis·
grace of human reason, mankind in all their controverfie8‚ whe-
ther about a notion or a thing, a predicament or a province,
have made their last appeal to brute force and violence. The
titles '⁴ with which these Leaders were honoured by their fol-
lowers, on account of the sublime reveries they taught, are at once
magnificent and absurd: and prove rather the superlative igno-
rance of those times than any transcendent merit in the men to
whom they were applied. From this censure we ought never-
theless to except One, who was a prodigy of knowledge for the
age he lived in, and is acknowledged as such by the age to
which Ι am writing. I mean the renowned F ryar Bacon, who
thone forth fingly thro the profound darkness of those times;
but rather dazzled than enlightened the weaker eyes of his co-
temporaries. As if the name of Bacon were auspicious to phi-
losophy, this Man, not only without assistance or encourage-
ment, but insulted and persecuted‚ by the unconquerable soree
of his genius penetrated far into the mysteries of nature, and
made so many new discoveries in Astronomy and Perspedfive, -
in Mechanics and Chymistry, that the most sober writers even
now cannot mention them without some marks of emotion and
wonder. It is Dr. Friend’s observation‚ that he was almost the
only Astronomer of his age: and the reformation of the Calen—
dar, by him attempted and in a manner perfeeted, is a noble
proof of his skill in that science. The construition of specta—
cles, of telescopes‚ of all sorts of glaffes that magnify or di-
minish objects‚ the composition of gunpowder (which Barthol-
(ἴω Swartz is thought to have first hit upon almost a century
later) are some of the many inventions with justice ascribed to
him. For all which, he was in his life-time calumniated‚ im-
prisoned‚ opprefl'ed: and after his death wounded in his good
name, as a magician who had dealt in artS, infernal and abo-

minable.
