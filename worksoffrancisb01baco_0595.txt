*Tum carl repaiting fr'om his govcrnmenr into this reahn in August last
contrary to her Maiesty's express and most judieial commandment, thouoh²
‘the contempt were in that point visible, and her Maiesty’s mind prepared ῖς)
indust and high displeasure, in tegar-d of that realm of Ireland set at hazard
by¹his former disobedience to her royal directions, yet kept that stay as
{he commanded my iord only to his chamber in court, until his allegati'ons
might by her privy-council be questioned and heard ς which account ”taken
alud my lord's answers appearing to be of no dcfence, that ssmdow of des
fence which was offered consisted of two parts, the one his own eon-
ccit of ibmelikelihood of good effetis to cnsue of the course held the
other a vehement and over-ruling persuasion of the council there, (though
he were indeed as absolutely freed from opinion of the council of Irelasid
as he was absolutely tied to her Majesty's trust and instruffionsl Neverthe1
less her Maiesty not unwilling to admit any extenuation of'his offenee3
and considering the one point required advertisement out of Ireland, and
the other further expectation of the event and scquel of the affairs there
(and so both points asked time and protradion 5) her Majesty procccdcd ffijf
with reservation, not to any restraint of my lor-d according to the nature
and degree of his offcnce, but to a commitment of him, ub libera cn 0-
dia, in the Lord—keeper's house.

AFTER, when both parts of this differcnce plainly failed my lorti, yea
and proved utterly adverse to him, (for the couneil of Irelandin plain ternis
disavowed all those his proceedings, and the event made a miserable inter-
· pretation of them 3) then her Majcsty began to behold the offence in nature
and likcncssg as it was divested from any palliation or cover, and in the
true proportion and magnitude thereof, importing the peril of a kingdom3
which consideration wrought in her Majesty a strange effe& <if a11y”t11ing
which is heroical in virtue can be strange in her nature) for when offence
x'vas grown unmeasurably offcnfive‚ then did grace superabound ,- and in
the heat of all the ill news out of Ireland, and other advertisements thence
to my lord's disadvantage, her Maiesty entred into a resolution, out of her
sclf and her inscrutable goodness‚ not to overthrow my lord's fortune ir-
reparably, by publick and proportionable justice: Notwithstanding‚ inas-
much as about that time there did fly about in London strects and theatres
divers seditious libels; and ‘Powles and Ordinaries were full of bold and
factious discourseS, whereby not only many of her Majesty's faithful and
zealous counsellots and servants were taxed, but withal the hard estate of
Ireland was imputed to any thing rather than unto the true cause (the
earl's defaults) though this might have made any Princc on earth to lay
assde straightways the former resolution taken, yet her Majesty in her mo-
deration perfistcd in her course of clemeney, and bethought herself of a
mean to right her own honour, and yet spate the earl's ruin3 and there·
fore taking a just and most necessary occasion upon these libels, of an ad-
monition to be given stasonably, and as is oft accustomed3 the last Star-
chamber day of Michaelmas term was pleased, that declaration lhould be
made, by way of testimony, of all her honourable privy-council, of her
M'ajesty’s infinite care, royal provisions, and prudent directions for the
prosecutions in Ireland, wherein the carl's errors (by which means so great
care and charge was frustrated) were incidently touched.
