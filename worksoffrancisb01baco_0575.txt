invention, but hath formerly been discerned by the founder sort of judg-
ments.. For we see that Solon, who was no contemplative wisc man, but
a statesman and a lawgiver, used a memorable censure to Croesizs, when
'he shewed him great trcal'urcs, and store of gold and suver that he had ga-
thered, telling him, that whensoever another should come that had better
iton thart he, he would be master of all his gold and filver. Neither is the
‘authority of Machiavel to be despised, speeially in a matter whercof he saw
the evidcnt expericncc before his eyes in his own times and country, who
'deridcth the received and current opinion and principle of estate taken first
‘from a speech of Matianus the lientenant of Vespasiam that money was
gie ssnews of war, affirming, that it is a mockery, and that there are no other
⁵ ’ uc sinews of war, but the finews and muscles of mens arms: and that there was
hever any war, wherein the more valiant people had to deal with the more
fflealtliy, but that the war, if it were well conducted, did nourilh and pay itself.
And had he not reason so to think, when he saw a needy, and ill-provided army
‘os the French (thoughyneedy, rather by ncgligence than want of means, as the
French manner ostentimes is) make their passage only by the reputation of their
Εἰσὶ-’(15 by their sides undrawn, thorough the whole length of Italy, (at
‘ffhat time abounding‘ in wealth after a long peace) and that without resistance,
and to seize and leave what countries and places it pleascd them? But it was
not the experience of that time alone, but the records of all times that do
eoncur to falfify that conceit, that wars are decided not by the {harpe-st
sword, but by the greatest purse. And that very text or saying of Mutiantts
*which was the original of this opinion, is misvouched, for his speech was
Pecuniae fiant nervi belli civilis, which is true, for that civil wars cannot
be between people of differing valour5 and again because in them men are
as oft bought as vanquilhed. But in case of foreign warS‚ you {hall scarcely
find any df the great monarehies of the world, but have had their foundations
in poverty and contemptible beginnings, being in that point also conform to
the hcavcnly kingdom, of which it is pronounced, Regnum ‘Dei non vemt
cum obftrvatione. Pessa, a mountainous country, and a poor people in
,comparison of the Mecles, and other provinces which they subdued. The
state of Sparta, a state wherein poverty was enasied by law and ordii-ranem
all use of gold and filvcr and rich furniture being interdiCted. The state of
‘Macedonia‚ a state mercenary and ignoble until the time of Philip. The
state of Rome, a state that had poor and pastoral beginnings. The state of
'the T urks, which hath been since the terror of the world, founded upon a
transmigration of some bands of Sarmatian Scythes, that del'cended in a
vagabond manner upon the province that is now termed ancomannias out
*of the remnants whereof, after great variety of fortune, sprang the Othoman
family. But never was any position of estate so vifibly and substantiam)-
'confirmed as this, touching the prehemincnce, yea and predominancy of
valour above treasure, as by the two desecnts and inundations of neeessitous
and indigent people, the one from the cast and the other from the west, that
of the Arabiam or Sarmens, and that os the Gothsg Vandals and the rest :
⁸ 1Νῐῑὴο, as if they had been the true inhesitors of the Roman Empire, then
dying, or at leastgrown impotcnt and aged, entered upon Egypt, Asia,
Graecia, Africk, Spain, France‚ coming to these nationS, not as to a prcy,
but as to a patrimony3 not returning with spoil, but seating and planting
themselves in a number of provinces, which continue their progcny, and

bear their names till this day. And all these men had no other wealthlbut
