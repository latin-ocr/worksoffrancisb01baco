ih our mind and apprehension they are all onc and the same nati0n3 and
that our heart is truly placed in the center ofgovernment, from whence au
lines to the circumferencc are equal and of one space and distance. But?

'for the further advancing and perfecti‘ng of this work, we have taken into

our princely care and cogitationS, what it is that may appe-rtain 100111 own,
imperial power, right, and authority 3¹ 31111 what requireth votes and astent&
of our parliaments or estaress· and again, what may presently be‘ done, and·
what must be left to further time, that our proceeding may be void of all in·-
eonveniencc and informality3 wherein by the example of Almighty God,
who is aceustomed to begin all 1115 great works and dcfignmcnrs by alterations
or impofitioras of names, as the firtest means ro÷imprint in the hearts of
pcople a character and expectation of that which ’15 10 follow; we have
thought good to withdraw and dffeontintle the divided names of England'
and Scotland out of our regal, style and title, and 10 use in place of themthe,
common and contracted name of Great Britany: 1101 upon any vain-glory,
whcreof we persuade our selvas our actions do sufficicntly free us in the iudgss
ment of all the 31011115Δ 3311 if any such humour lhould reign in 115, it were
better satisfied by length of style, and enumeration of kingdoms: but only*
as a fit signification of that which is already done, and‘ a significant prefigura÷
tion of that which we further intend. For as in gIving names to natural per-2
sonS, itis used to impolethem‘rninfaney, and not tostay tillfulness ofgrowthss
soit scemed 10 us not unscasonable to bring in further use this name at the first,
and to proceed to the more substantial points of the unionaftcr, 35 first and
35 far as the common good of both the realms lhould permit, especially conss
fidering the name of Britasqr was 110 coincd or new-devised or affected name
at pleasure, but the true and· ancient name which God and time hath impo-
fed, extant, and received 111 histories, in cards, and in ordinary speech and
writing, where the whole issand is meant to be denominate, so as it is not
accompanied with so much as any 111-3113011115 in common speech. And al-
though wc never doubted, neither ever heard that any other presumcd to
doubt, burthat the form and tenor of our regal style and title, and the dc-
lineation of the same, did only and wholly of mere right appertain to our
supreme and absolute prerogative to express the same, 111 such words or sort,
35 secmcd good to our royal plcasure: Yet because we were to have the advice
and ass‘cnt of our parliament concerning other points of the union, wc were
pleased our said parliament should, amongst the rest, take also the same into
their confideration. But finding by the grave opinion of our judges,· who
ate the interpreters of our laws‚ that in case that alteration of style which
seemccl to us but verbal, 11103111 be established and enafied by parliament, i't
might involve by implication and consequence, not only a more present al-
teration, but 31103 further innovation than‘we any ways intendcd3 orat least
might be subject to some colourable scruplc of such a perilo'us constr-utnon z
