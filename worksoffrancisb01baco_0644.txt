OF THE INTERPRETATION

oracle of knowledge, man transgress'ed and fell; but in pursuit towards the η
similitude of God's goodness or love (which is one thing, for love is nothing
else but goodness put in motion or applied ) neither man or spirit ever hath
transgressed, or shall transgress.

The angel of light that was, when he prcsiimcd before his fall, said with-
in himself, I will ascend and be like anto tloe hzghest ‚- not God, but the
highest. To be like to God in goodncss, was no part of his emulation:
knowledge, being in creation an angelos light, was not the want which did
most sollicit him3 only because he was a minister he aimcd at a supremacy;
therefore his clinibing or ascenfion was turned into a throwing down or
precipitation. ν

MAN on the other side, when he was temptcd before he fell, had offered
iiiito him this suggestion, that hefhoulcl be like anto God. But how? no‘t
simply, but in this part, knowt'ng good and evil. For being in his creation
invested with sovetcignty of all inferior creaturcS, he was not needy of
power or dominion. But again, being a spirit newly enclosed in a body of
carth, he was fittest to be allurcd with appetite of light and liberty of know-
ledge. Theresore this approachiiig and intruding into God’s secrets and
mys'terics, was rewarded with a further removing and estranging from God's
presence. But as to the goodnels osGod, there is no danger in contend-
ing or advancing towards a similitude thereos ,ς as that which is open and pro-
pounded to our imitati-on. For that voice (whereof the heathen and all
other errors of religion have ever confeffed that it sounds not like man)
Love y'our enemies ‚- beyou likeuntoyour heavengy father, tharsitffereth
his rdin to fall both upon thejust and the ury‘ust‚d0th well declam, that we
can in that point commit no excess. So again we find it often repeated in
the old law, Beyou hely as I am hely 3 and what is holiness else but good-
nesS, as we consider it separate, and guarded from all mixture, and all acc‘ess
of evil? -

Wnssnssfomz seeing that knowledge is of the number of those things
which are to be accepted of with cantion and distinffion ς being now to open
aforintain, such as it is not easy to discern where the iffues and streams
thercof will take and fall3 [thought it good and necessary In the first place,
to make astrong and found head or bank to rule :ind guide the course ofthe
water-53 by setting down this position or firmament, namely, That dll
knowledge is to be limited by religion, and to be referred to ufi² and amora

Fon if any inan shall think by view and enquiry into these scnfibie and
material things, to attain to any light for the revealing of the nature or will
ofGod; he shall dangcroussy abuse himself. It is true, that the contempla-
tion of the creature's of God hath for end (as to the natures of t'h'e creatures
themselves) knowledge3 but asto the nature of God, no knowledge, but
wonder : which is nothing else but contemplation broken off', or‘loosing it

self. Nay further, as it was aptly said by one of ‘Plato's school, thesbnfi of
man refhmbles the fitn, which openeth and revealeth the terrestrialglobe,
but obscureth and concealeth the celestiak so doth the sense discover natu-
ral things, but darken and shut up divine. And this appeareth' sufficicntlyin
that there is no proceeding in invention of knowledge, but by finiilitude3
and (iod is only self-liKe, having nothing in common with any creature,
otherwise than as in shadow and tropc. Therefore attend his will as himself
openeth it, and give unto faith that which unto saith belongeth3 for more
worthy it is to believe than to think or know, confidering that in knowledge
