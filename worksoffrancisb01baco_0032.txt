EmzAssETH had raised that young Lord, thro a series„ '62‘
honorS, to be Earl Marshal of England :⁴ and was every dat·
giving him new proofs of a particular and uncomm'on' este-ens.
This only servedto exasperatehis enemies. They were power}
ful, and closely united. But as they durst not attack him openl⁴ *⁹

they had recourse to dark and furer arts of vengeance3 agai

which his openness of temper, unsuspectingand improvident,'jx-iz'{il
no wise guarded. In truth, his imperious humour, which* ,ξ
could seldom disguise, aided their defigns3 for it often brolss'e
forth into downright abuse and scorn of those who thwar‘t'etg
his projectS, or diffented from his opinions: and he once,‘ iii
some dispute with the Qeen herself, turned his back abrupt‘l‘yss
upon her with all the marks of disrespe& and contempt. Pro·-

dignity of her character, struck the Earl a box on the *e'ar‘zss

of historians, who have remarked severely on the unjustifiable
treaty he made with the Arch—rebel fljzrone, on the private con-
serence they held together, and on his precipitate return to
England, against the Qeen’s express orders, This lastillstep

and then stopped all vessels that were to sail for Ireland'except
one which he ordered thither on purpose with a? seigned report
of her death. Fatally deceived by this intelligence, Effex
sailed away in a hurry for Englancl, attended only by a few of
his friends· The Qeen received him without any emotio'n
either of anger or affection, and having confined him to his*
own house, ordered his conduct to be examined in the star-
chamber. At this usage of him, however gracious and nio-⁷
derate, the people‚ whose idol he was, loudly exclaimed: and>
