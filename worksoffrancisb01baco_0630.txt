CERTIFICATE TOUCHING

for it is no composition, but a dis-
continuance3 andin that case there
isno penalty, but costs: and the poor
subject will never sue for his costs,
lest it awake the informer to revive
his information‚ and so it escapeth
clearly.

2 . IN F οι( Μ E Rs receive penfions of
divers persons to forbear them. And
this is commonly of principal offen-
ders, and of the wealthiest sort of
tradesmcn. For if one tradcsman
may presumo to break the law, and
another not, he will be soon richer
than his fellows. As for example, if
one draper may use tenters‚ because
he is in fee with an informer, and o-
thers not, he will soon outstrip the
good tradcsman that keeps the law.

AN D if it be thought strange that
any man should seek his peace by one
informer, when he lieth open to all,
the expericnce is otherwise: for one
informer will bear with the friend of
another, looking for the like measure.

Am> bcfidcs they have deviscs ro
get priority of infor-marion, and to
put in an inform ation de bene effi, to
prevent others, and to protect their
pensioncrs.

AN D if it be said this is a pillory
matter to the informer, and there-
fore he will not attempt it3 although
therein the statute is a little doubtful :
yet if hanging will not keep thieves
stom stcahng, it is not pillory will
keep informers from polling.

A N D hcrcin Sir Stephen addcth a
notable circumstance: that they will
pei-use a trade, as of brewcrs or victu-
allcrs, and if any stand our, and will
not be insec, they will find means to

have a dozen informations come upon
him at once.

3. Tri r: subiect is often for the same
offence vexed by several informations:
sometimes the one informer not
knowing of the othcr3 and osten by
confederacy to weary the party with
charge: upon every of which goeth

process,

2. Tms is :in abuse that appeareth
not by any proeecding in court, bc-
cause it is before suit commenced,
and therefore requircth a particular
enquiry.

B U T when it {hall be the carc and
cogitation of one man to overlook in-
formers, these things are easily disco-
vered: for let him but look who they
be that the informer calls in question,
and hearkcn who arc of the same trade.
in the same place and are spared‚ and
it will be easy to tracca bargain:

IN this case, having discovered the
abuso, he ought to inform the barons
of the exchequcr, and the King's learn-
ed council, that by the·star-chamber,
or otherwise, such taxers of the King's
subjeets may be punistied.

3.T1-1 Ε officer keeping a book of
all the informations put in, with a
briefnotc ofthe matter, may be made
acquaintcd nith all informationis to
come in: and if lie find a precedent
for the sinc cause, hc may inform
tome.
