OF THE 1N‘TERPRETAT10N

of wisdom and knowledge. =

ΛΝΒ lest any man should retain a scruple, as if this thirst of knowledge
were rather an humour of the mind, than an emptinefs or want in nature

and an 1111111161 from Gods the same author defineth of it fully, saying, ²
God laath made every thing in beauty according to fiasbn ,- also he hathfit.

the world in man's heart, yet can he not find out the work which God
worketh from the beginning to the end : declaring not obscurely that Goci
hath framed the mind of man as a glass‚ capabie of the image of the universa}
world, joying to receive the lignature thereos, 'as the eye is of light 3 yea,
not only satisfied in beholding the variety of things, and vicissirude of times,
but raised also to find out and disccrn those ordinances and dccrees, which
throughout all these ,changes arc infanibly observed. And although the
highest generality of motion, or summary law of nature, God should stili
reservo within his own cnrtain ς yet many and noble are the inferior and se-
condary operations which arc within man's founding. This is athing which.
Ι cannot tell whethcrlmay so plainly speak as truly conceive, that as all.
knowledge appeareth to bc a plant of God’s own planting, so it may seem
the spreading and flourilhing, or at least the bearing and frustifying of this
plant, by a providcnce of God, nay, not only by a general providente,- but
by a special prophecy, was appointed to this autumn of the world: for to my
under-standing, it is not violent to the letter, and safe now after the event, so
to interpret that place in the prophecy of Daniel, where speaking of the
latter times, it is said, Illam shall paſs to and fra, anclfiience fhall be en·-
creafi’d ; as if the opening of the world by navigation and commerce, and
the further discovery of knowledge should meet in one time ot age.

Bu τ howsoever that be, there are besides the authorities of scripturcs be-
fore recited, two reasons of execeding great weight and force, why religion
should clearly protect all increase of natural knowledge: the one, because&
leadcth rothe greater exaltation of the glory of God3 for as the psalms and
other scripturcs do often invite us to consider, and to magnify the great and
wonderful works of God3 so if we should rest only in the contemplation of
those shews which first offer themselves to our senseS, we should do a 11110111-
jnry to the majesty of God, as if we should judge of the store of some excel·-
lent jeweller, by that only which is set out to the street in his shop. The
other reason iS, because it is a singular help and a preservat‘rve against unbe-
1101 and error: fot saith out Saviour, Tou err, not knowing the scripturcs,
‘nor the power of God,· laying before us two books or volumcs to study, if
we will be securcd from error3 first, the scripturcs revcaling the will of
God, and then the creatures expressing his powet3 for that latter book will
certify uS, that nothing which the first teacheth lhall be thought impossible.
And most sure it is, and a true conclusion of expericnce, that a little natural
philosophy inclincth the mind to atheilin, but a further proceeding bring-
eth the mind back to religion.

To conclude them Let no man presume to check the liberality of God's
gists, 11110, as was said, hathfit the world in man's heart. So as whatso-
ever is not God, but parcel of the world, he hath fitted it to the compre—

}{cngion of xlnan's mind, if man will open and dilate the powers of his under-
an ing as 10 may. ·
