but the author judged, that, in an affair so complicatedtand
important, some other things ought to precede, partly -sor in·-.
strucStion, and partly 'for present use. He therefore interposed
a fourth and fifth part: the former of which he named Scaba
Intellefz‘us, ‘or a series of steps by which the Understanding
might regularly ascend in its philosophical researches. Forthis
purpose, he proposed examples of enquiry and investigatipn,
agreeable to his own method, in certain subjeets3 selee’ting such·
especially as are of the noblest order, and most widely differing
from one another3 that instances of every sort might not-he·
wanting. The fourth part then was to contain a particular ap-
plication and illustration of the second. In this light we claust·
to confidet the fix monthly histories which he proposed to write
on fix principal topics in natural history: namely, of windsg >of
life and death 3 os rarefaction and condensation; of the three
chymical principles, salt, sulphur, mercury3 of bodies heavy
and light3 of sympathy and antipathy. The'first three, inthe
order Ι have here placed them, he prosecuted at some length;
and in a manner that shews with what a happy sagacity he
could apply his own rules to the interpretation os nature. The
wonder is, that other enquirers since his time have done so little
towards perfecting the two first mentioned, things os so great
concern to human society, and to every individual. As to the
three last, we have only a {hort introducstion to each: death
having prevented him from writing any thing on the subjeets
themselves. Such is our eondition here: whoever is capable of
planning useful and extenfive schemes dies always too soon for
mankind, even in the most advanced age.

5. Of the fifth part he has left nothing but the title and

⁰' scheme. It was indeed to be only a temporary strueture, raised

with such materials as he himself had either invented, or tryed,
or improved 3 not according to the due form of genuine induc-
tion‚ but by the same common use os the understanding that

others had employed. And this was to remain no longer than ·

phy purely axiomatical and scientific 3 flowing from that just,
castigated‚ genuine manner of enquiry‚ which the author first
invented and applied. But this he despaired of being able to

accomplish:
