variety of faces or ffiapes. An enumeration of them according to popular
note. That at the first one would conceive that in the schools by natural
philosophy were meant the knowledge of the efficients of things concreate;
and by metaphyfick the knowledge os the forms of natures fimple5 which is
a good and fit division of knowledge: but upon examination there is no
such matter by them intended. That the little enquiry into the production
. of fimple nature8‚ {heweth well that works were not fought3 because by

the former knowledge some small and superficial deflexions from the ordina:

ry generations and productions may be found out, but the discovery of all
,profound and mdical alteration must asise out of the latter knowledge.

F the error in propounding the search of the maten-als, or dead be-
ginnings or principles of things, and not the nature of motions‚ in-
clinations and. applications. That the whole scope of the former search is
impertinent and vain3 both because there are no such beginningS, and if there
were they could not be known. That the latter manner of search (which is
all) they pass over compendioussy and ssightly as a bye matter. That the se-
veral conceits in that kind3 as that the lively and moving beginnings of things
should be shift or appetite of matter to privation3 the spirit of the world;
working in matter according to platforms the proceeding or fructifying of
distinct kinds according to their proprieties; the intercourse of the elements
by mediation of their common qualities3 the appetite of like portions to u-
nite themselves5 amity and discord, or sympathy and antipathy3 motion to
'the centre‚ with motion of stripe or press; the casual agitation‚ aggregatim,
and effays of the solid portions in the void space3 motion of [huttings and o-
penings‚ {are all mere nugations. Ἴ And that the calculating and ordination
of the true degrees, momentS, limits and laws of morions and alterations (by
means whereof all works and, effe-Cis are produced) is a matter of a far other
nature, than to consist in such easy and wild generalitics.

F the great error of inquiring knowledge in anticipations. That 1

call anticipations; the voluntary collections that the mind maketh of
knowledge, which is every man's reason. That though this be a solemn thing,
and serves the turn to negotiate between man and man (because of the con·
formity and participation osmen's minds in the like errors) yet towards en-
quiry of the truth ofthings and works, it is of no value. That civil respests
are a lett that this pretended reason should not be so contemptibly spoken of,
as were fit ancl medicinable‚ in regard that hath been too much exalted and
glorified, to the infinite detriment of man's estate. Of the nature of words,
and their facility and aptness to cover and grace the defects of anticipations.
That it is no marvel if these anticipations have brought forth such diverstty
and repugnancc in opini0n5‚ theories or philospplfies, as so many fablc‚ of
several arguments. That had not the nature ofcivil customs and governmcnt
been in most times sornewhat adverse to such innovations, though· contem-
plative, there might have been, and would have been many more. That the
second school of the Academicks and the sectr of Pyrrho, or the considerers5
that denied comprehension as to the disabling of man's knowledge (entertain-

edin anticipations) is well to be allowed: but that they ought, when they
