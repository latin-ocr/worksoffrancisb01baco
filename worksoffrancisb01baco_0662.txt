of idols or false appearances that offer themselves to the understanding in the.
inquisition of knowledge 3 that is to say, the idols of the tribe, the idols of the
palace, the idols of the eave, and the idols of the theatre: That these four, added
to the incapacity of the mind, and the vanity and malignity of the affec'tions,
leave nothing but impoteney and confusion. A recital of the particular kinds

anticipations and observations, and so vanished. That if any have had the
strength of mind generally to· purge away and discharge all anticipation53
they have not had that greater and double strength and patience of mind, as
well to repel new anticipations after the view and search of particulars, as {o

history flown up to· principles without the mean degrees, and so frasne-d all
the middle generalities or- axioms, not by way of scale or ascension from par-

infinite chaos of ihadows and moths, wherewith both books and minds have
been hitherto, and may be yet hcreaftcr much more pessered. That in the
course ofthose derivations to make them yet the more unprofitable they have
