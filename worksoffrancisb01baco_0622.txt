ARGUMENT CONCERNIN'G

=within the true state and compass', which will discharge many popular ἐπ’·
guments, and contra& the debate into a less room.

XVHEREFORE Ι do deliver the question, and exclude or set by, as noi:
in question, five things. Fir-st, the question is de portorio, and not de triss.
bute, to use the Roman words for explanation sake3 it is not, isay, touch-
ing any taxes within the' land, but of payments at the ports. Secondly, it ”
is not ronching any impost from port to port, but where claves regni the keys
of the kingdom are turned to let in from foreign parts, or to send forth to'
foreign part53 (in a word) matter of commerce and intercourse, not simply
of carriage or Veiture. Thirdly, the question is (as the distinelion was u-
sed above in another case) de vero & false), ancl not de bono &malm of
the legal point, and not of the inconvenience, otherwise than as it serves
to decide the law. Fourrth, Ido setapartthree commodities‚ wools, wool·
fells, and leather‚ as being in different case from the rest3 because the custom
upon them is antiqua czstuma. Lastly‚ the question is not whether in matter
ofimposing, the King may alter the law by his prerogative, but whether the
King have not such a prerogative by law. ,

THE state of the question being thus cleared and freed, my proposition
is, that the King by the fundamental laws of this kingdom hath a power to
impose upon merehandise and commodities both native and foreign. In my
proof of this proposition all that l shall say, be it to confirm or confine, Ι.
will draw into certain distinet heads or considerations which move me and ,
may move you.

THE first is an universal negative: there appeareth not in any of the King's
'courts any one record wherein an imposition laid at the ports, harh been
overthrown by judgment; nay more, where it had been questioned by plead-
ing. This plea‚ *qnod sttmma praediffi‘a minus juste imposita fuit, &⁶ contra
leges dy confitetudines regni hujus Angliae‚ unde idem Bates illam sblvere
recufilvit prout ei bene licuit ,- is primae imprffonis. Bates was the first
man ab orzgine mundi (for any thing that appeareth) that ministred that plea3
whereupon Ioffer this to consideration: the King's acts that grieve the sub·
jc& are either against law and so void, or according to striclness of law, and
yet grievous And according to these several natures of grievance, there be
several remedies: be they against law? overthrow them by judgment: be
they too streight and extreme, though legal ? propound them in parliament.
for as much then as impositions at the ports, having been so often laid
were never brought into the King's courts of justice, but still brought to par·
limitent, I may most certainly conclude, that they were conceived not to
bc against law. And if any man shall think that it was too high a point to
question by law before the judges, or that there should want fortitude in
them to aid the subjeet3 no, it shall appear from time to time in cases of
equal reach where the King’s afts have been indeed against law, the course
of law harh run, and the judges have worthily done their duty.

As in the case of an imposition upon linnen cloth for the alnage ,- over-
thrown by judgment.

mination without convie'tion by jury, disallowcd by the judges.
