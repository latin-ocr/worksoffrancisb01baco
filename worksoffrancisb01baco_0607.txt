” inquisition, as title of land. With Ferrara and the Venetiam is ancient
enmity, specially because he receiveth all their banilhed and fugitives. They
ἶ make most account of the Duke of Savqy amongst the Princcs of I tuly. They
“ maintain divers ainbassadors abroad‚ with the Turk, the Emperor, France
· Spain, and at Rome: with them is an ambass'ador of France and Savoy als
’· *gays resident, and an agent of Spain, because they gave the preseance to

³ IN this it seemeth all the potentates of Italy do agree to let all private
‘⁶ grudges give place to foreign invasion, more for doubt of alteration in re-
ligion, than for any other civil cause.
› ⁴' THERE is none amongst them at this day in any likclihood to grow to any

«μ’ ‘Tufiany seeketh rather title than territory, otherways than by purchalincr.
⁷ S A VO Y is yet young3 the rest os no great force of themselves. Fance

offered, and suffering the King of Spain to settle himself.

’ THE Emperor Adolphe of the houte of Austriche, son to Maximilian‚ssmpe101.j

' THE ordinary garrisons in Hungary are to the number of but
evil paid at this time.

· Tua revenues and subfidies of Hungary do not pass 100,000 flor-ins. The

last Emperor affirmed solemnly, that the charge of Hungary amounted to

one million and a half.

’ THE revenues of Bolaemia, ordinary and extraordinary‚ amount to 50000

dollars.

IN the absence of the Emperor, the Baron of Rosbmberg is governor of
Boloemia, who poss‘effeth almost a fourth part of that country, and is a papist;
neither he nor his brother have children: he beareth the Emperor in hand to
‘make him his heir.

made between them 45000 flor-ins a-piece‚ as well for Austriclae, as that might

hereafter fall unto them by the decease of theArchduke Ferdinand in Trrol,
