The abufts or inconveniencies.

1. AFTER an information is ex-
hibited and answered, (for so the sta-
tute requires) the informer for the
³most part groweth to composition
with the defendant: which he can-
not do without petil of the statute,
except he have licence from the court,
which licence he ought to return by
order and course of the court, together
with a declaration upon his oath of the
true sum that he takes for the compo-
fition. Upon which licence so return-
ed, the court is to tax a fine for the
King.

T H Is ought to be, but as it is now
used, the licence is seldom returned.
And although it contain a clause that
the licence shall be void, if it bc not
duly returncd; yet the manner is
ito suggest that they arc still in tei-ms of
composition, and so to obtain new
days, and to linger it on till a parlia-
mcnt and a pardon come.

ALso when the licence is return-
ed3 and thereupon the judge or baron
to sess'e a fine: there is none for the
King to inform them ofthe nature of
the offence, of the value to grow to
the King if the suit prevail3 of the a-
bility of the person, and the like. By
reason whereof, 'the fine that is set is
«but a trifle, as 20, 30, or 40 s. and it
runs in aform likewise which I do not
well like: for it is ut parcatur mfis,
which pur-porteth, as if the party did
not any way submit himself, and take
,the composition as of grace of the
court, but as if he did justify himself,

The remedies.

1. THE officer in this point is to
perform his greatest service to the
King, in solliciting for the King in
such sort as licences bc duly returned,
the deceits of these fraudulent com—
positions discovered, and fines may
be set for the King in some good pro-
portion, having respect to the valucs
both of the matter and the person:
for the King's fines are not to be de-
livered, as moneys given by the party
ad redimendam vexationem, but as
moneys given, ad redimendam cul-
pam &⁶ poenam legis-5 and ought to
be in such quantity, as may not make
the laws altogether trampled down
and contemned. Thcrefore the offi-
cer ought first to be maele acquainted
with every licence, that he may have
an eye to the sequel of it : then ought
he to be the person that ought to pre-
fer unto the judgcs or barons, as well
the bills for the taxations of the fines,
as the orders for giving further days,
to the end that the court may bc duly
informecl both of the wcight of causeS,
and the delays therein used z and lastly,
he is to sec that the fines sess'ed be dul y
put in procesS, and answered.
