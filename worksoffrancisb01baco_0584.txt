Mr. BAcoN’s Diseourse in the praise of his
Sovereign.

her praise that plantcth, and 11ouriffleth magnanimity by her example,

love by her person, and knowledge by the peace and serenity of her

times. And if these rich pieces be so fair unser, what are they set, and set
in all perfeetion? Magnanimity no doubt confisteth in contempt of peril, in
contempt of profit, and in meriting of the times wherein one liveth. For
contempt of peril, see a lady that cometh to a crown after the expet-leuce of
sonte adverse fortune, which for the most part extenuateth the mind, and

encouraged thei-eto by the strength she found in leugues and alliances with
great and potent confederates? No, but {he found her realm in wars
with her nearest and mightiest neighbourS. She stood single and alone,
and in league only with one, that vafter the pcople of her nation had made
his war-s, left her to nmke her own peace3 one that could never be by any
sollieitation moved to renew the treuties 5 and one that since harh proceed ed
