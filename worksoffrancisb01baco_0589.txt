OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.

,because it is known {he did never much affe& the holding of that town
'to her own usc3 it was left, and her forces withdrawn, yet did that no-
thing diirfinish her merit of the crown, and namely of that party who re-
covered by it such strength, as by that and no other thing they sublisted
long after : and lest that any should finisterly and malicioussy interpret that
stie did nourilh those divisions; who knoweth not what faithful advice,
continual and earnest sollicitation she used by her embaffadors and ministers
to the French Kings suecessively, and to their mother, to move them to
keep their edicas of pacification‚ to retain their own authority and greatness
by the union of her subjeds? Which counsel, if it had been as happily
followed, as it was prudently and fincerely given3 France at this day had
been a most flourilhing kingdom, which now is a ,theatro of misery. And
‚now at last, when the said house of Guisb, being one of the whips of
flod, whereof themselves are but the cordS, aud Spain the stoek, had by
their infinite aspiring practices wrought the miracles of states, tovmake
τε King in posscffion long established to play again for his crown, without
‚any title of a competitor, without any invasion of a foreign enemy, yea,
⁴‘without any combination in substance of a blood royal or nobility3 but
only by furring in audacious persons into sundry governmenr, and by
making the populace of towns drunk with seditious preachers: And that
King Henry the third, awaked by those preffing danger-s, was compelled
to execute the duke of Guise without ceremony3 and yet nevel-theleile,
found the despair of so many persons embarked and engaged in that con-
spitacy, so violent, as the flame thereby was little ass'uaged5 so that he was
inforcecl to implore her aids and succours : Conffler, how benign care and
‘good correspondence she gave to the distreffed requests of that King3 and
he soon after, being by the sacrilegious hand of a wretched Jacobin lifted
up against the sacred person of his natural sovereign, taken away, not
wherein the criminous blood of Gmst, but the innocent blood which hc
hath often spilled by instigation of him and his house was revenged, and
that this worthy gentleman who reigneth come to the crown3 it will
not be forgotten by so grateful aKing, nor by so observing an age, how
ready, how opportune and reasonable, how royal and sufficient her suc-
cours were, whereby she enlarged him at that time, and preferred him
to his better fortune: and ever fince in those tedious warS, wherein he
hath to do with a nydra, or a monster with many headS, lhe hath sup-
ported him with treasure, with forces, and with imployment of one that
lhe favoureth most. What shall I speak of the offering of Dan Anthony
to his fortune3 a devoted catholick, only commended unto her by his
oppressed state? What {hall I say of the great storrn of a mighty invasion,-
not of preparation, but in aet by the ank upon the King of Poland,
lat'e'ly dissipated only by the beams of her reputation: which with the
Grand Signor is greater than that of all the states of Europe put toge-
' ther? But let me rest upon the honourable and continual aid and relief lhe
hath gotten to the distreffed and desolate peoplc of the Low Countries ,-
a people recommended unto her by ancient confederaey and daily inter-
course, by their cause so innocent, and their fortune so lamentable. And
yet notwithstanding, to keep the conformity of her own procecding never
stained with the least note of ambition or malice, she refused the sovereignty
of divers of those goodly provinces offered unto her with great instance,

'to have been accepted with great cgnteritineiit both of her own pcoplek
