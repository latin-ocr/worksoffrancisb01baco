First, Τ1131· 111 1110 measuring or [1113001113Γσ10111101311101013 commonly
too much ascribed to largenels of territory,

S econdly, That there 1s too Dmuch ascribed to treasure or 1101103.

Thirdly‚T11at there 13 100 much ascribed to the fruitfulnels of the soil,
or affluence 01 commoditieS.

And Fourthh‘² That there is too much ascribed to the strength and
fortification of towns, or 1101013.

The latter will fall into this distribution: ·
- szst, That true greatness doth requi-re a fit situation of the place* or

rc01011.

Secozdgm That true greatness confistetli ess'entially in population and breed
of men.
Thirdht, That it consisteth also m the valour and military disposition of
the pcople 1t breedcth3 and 111 11113,11131 they make profeffion of arms.
Fourthly, That it conssteth in this point, that every common subiet-‘ii by

degrees of men.

F fthly That it confisteth 111 1110 temper of the government fit to 100ορ

condition of servile v asshls.

And Sixthly‚ That 11 confisteth· 111 1110 eommandment of the sea.

of that which 13 pioper to the amplitude and growth of stateS‚ and not of
that which 13 common 10 111011· preiervati0n, happinesS‚ and all other points
