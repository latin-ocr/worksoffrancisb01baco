measure but that of his paffion, which was as extreme as

it seemed unaccountable. Car, in four or five years -of
favour, from a mere adventurer was raised to be Earl rrum
of Somerflt .- and amaffed an enormous estate of nineteen Εὲῗζῖῗᾛέφ
thousand pounds a year in land 3 befides plate, money, and
jewels to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds more.
And yet he deserves a place in history, only for his scandalous
amour with the Countess of Effex 3 for procuring her to be di· Q
vorced from her husband, and for combining with her to poi-
son his friend, who had diffuaded him from that ill step. The
fate of Sir Thomas Overbury3 the dark and dreadful scene of
guilt that ushered it in 3 and the part those two great criminals
aeted in that tragedy, are recounted by all historiatis. Tho the
hm·rible transaction lay yet wrapt up in darkness, and was not
discovered till two years after, remorse and the upbraidings
of conscience pursued Sammset every where. T hro all the
splendor of fortune and favour, the trouble of his mind
was vifible in his ‘countenance, in his whole deportment.

these external and ssight accomplifhments. The Courtiers,
whom envy and interest render extremely {harp-fighted, quickly

defigns, there now appeared at court another young man, fit- m
ted by nature to draw the curiosity of James, and to supplant
the Earl of Somerstt in his favour. This was the famous George Wslſsu, p 79.
V illiers, the younger son of a good family in Leicestetfhire;
afterwards Duke of Buckingham. As the surprising elevation
of this youth had a particular infiuence on the future for-
tuneS‚ and even on the fall, of Sir Francis Bucen, his cliaradffter
will deferve a place at large in this history.

His mother, who could not give him a fortune, bestowed
on him such an education as might enable him to acquire one,
especially in a court like this. The advantages he owed to na—
ture, such as a handsome face, a body exadtly proportioned, an
case and gracefulness in his motions, she had taken care to im-

prove with that elegance of mannerS, that artificial politeness,
