THE LIFE o‘F THE'

suddenly, by the following accident. He was under the hands
of his barber, and, the weather being sultry‚ had ordered a
window before him to be thrown open. As he was become
very corpulent, he presently fell asseep in the current of fresh
air that was blowing in upon him3 and awaked after some
time, distempered all over. Why, said he to the servant, did·
you suffer me to sseep thus exposed? The fellow replied, that·
he durst not presume to disturb him. Then, said the Lord‘
Keeper, by your civility Ilose my life: and so removed into
his bed-chamber, where he died a few days after. Thus there
remained to his youngest son only the small proportion of a
sum, which was to be divided among five brothers.

THE narrowness of his circumstances obliged him to think of
some profeffion for a subfistance : and he applied himself, more
thro neceslity than choioe, to the study of the common law. For
that purpose, he placed himself in the society of Gray’s-Inn3
where his superiour talents rendered him the ornament of th'e'}⁴
House: as the gentleness and affability of his deportment won »
him the affedtion of allits members.· Iri his profeffion, he quickly
rose to so much eminence and reputation, that, at the age of
twenty eight years, he was named by Elizabeth her learned coun-'
cil extraordinary: a distinffion which he needed no affistanc'e'
from his father's merit with her to deserve. lt was however next
to impossible that so noble a genius, born to embrace the whole
compass of science, should confine its researcbes within the
narrow and perplexed study of precedents and authorities; a
study hedged round with brambles and thornS‚ dark and bar'ss
barous in its beginnings, and rendered in its progress still more
obscure, by the learned dulness of commentators and compilers:
men, for the most part, of indefatigable industry‚ and of no
spirit or discernment. Accordingly we find that in this inter-
val he often gave full scope to his *conceptions ; surveying the
whole state of learning, observing its defesis, and imagining
the proper methods to supply them. This he first attempted
in a treatise which he entitled THE GREATEST Bmm or ΤιΜΕ ;
as appears from a letter, written after his retirement, to father
Fulgentio the V enetian, in which he paffes a kind of censure
on the pompous and swelling title prefixed to it. Tho the
piece itself is lost, it appears to have been the first outlines of
that amazing defign, which he afterwards filled up and finished
