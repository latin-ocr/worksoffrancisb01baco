· THE LIFE OF THE

that might do honour to the best of mena These her natural
endowments received much, tho severe, improvement from the
dangers 1116 was exposed to in the first part of her life. She
orew up in 3 stric‘t attention over her own actions, even over her
lboks and wordS, from the rigor of her father’s temper,- and
particularly from the jealous cruelty of her fister’s administra*
tion : a 111011 but memorable period of time! when England
beheld‚ under a female reign, such instances of merciless tage,
such scenes of horror, as had of old startled the Roman' World,
under a Nero and a Domitian. The dreadful genius of that
superstition to which she had devoted herself, then exer-ted
its spirit undisguffed, in betraying, tormenting, butchering, by
the ministry of inhuman priests and inquifitors‚ whoever would
not profess what he could not poffibly believe. If we may cre- · ’
dit Historiam, they had even doomed Elizabeth her sels to diez'
and she escaped‚ miraculoussy, not by the kindness, but the
policy of Philip3 himself a tyram, the coolest and most deter-
mined of these latter ages.

AT her acceffion to the throne, she found her revenues an-
ticipated or exhausted 3 her kingdom, thro the sanguinary
madness of her predeceffor, disjointed and broken of its vigor
within: at the same time unsupported by allies and without
consideration abroad. Her good sense led her to see, by the
errors of her father and her sister, that 1116 could expect to
reign with security, only by deserving the confidence and
gaining the love of the nation: and that in order thereto, she
must propose to herself no other end of ruling but the happi—
ness and honour of all her people. This system os policy‚ so
fimple in itself‚ so glorious in its consequmces, and yet by princes
so seldom pursued, 1116 adhered to steadily, almost uniformly‚
thro a long and triumphant reign 3 for this very reason triumphant!

THE reformation of religion she attempted and effected 3 at
3 season when her power was uneonfirmed‚ and in probable
danger from intestine commotions. For revolutions in religion
are apt to put the whole constitution of a society into ferment,
even more strongly than alterations in government ; as every
individualis immediately and intimately adtuated by what seems
to him of highest and most lasting concern. She kept awake,
and animated, with wonderful address, the divifions in Scot—
land, in France, in the Netherlands : and that with more

justice
