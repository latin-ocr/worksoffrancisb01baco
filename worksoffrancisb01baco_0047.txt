LORD CHANCELLOR ΒΑΕ-ΟΝ. xxv

“ done fince 1 was born, and which, not done, hath bred al-
“ most a wilderness and solitude in the King's service: which
“ is, that you countenance, and encourage, and advance able
“ and virtuous men in all kinds, degree8‚ and profeffions.”

This excellent advice the Favourite received with thankfulness;
⁵ and negleffited. ,

Tuo the King's paffion was now wholly diverted upon a An. 1616.
new objest, he still affe&ed to treat &merset with kindness VN
and distinetion3 even after the discovery of his being an ac-
complice in poisoning Sir Thomas Overbmy had rendered this
diffimulation not only mean but criminal. Yet he continued Wlson,p-81.1
it to the last, embracing with fondness the man whom he
had secretly ordered to be arrested: and entreating him to
hasten his return, when he believed he should never see him
more. In such trifles he was fond to exert his talent of po-
litical management. The Earl's unhappy passion for the
young Countess of Effex was the source of all his misfor-
tunes, and drew after it the most terrible consequences: end÷
ing, as I have already observed,> in the murder of his friend ;
in the ruin of himself, and of her to whom he had trea-
cheroussy sacrificed that friend. The whole affair is displayed
at full length in our Author's charges against those two prime
agents in that infernal conspiracy. They were both found M²y24125³
guilty, sentenced to die, and afterwards pardoned by the King, {5331}ssssss
notwithstanding his solemn imprecations to the contrary, on ³43·
himself and his posterity.

, CER-riam historians have remarked‚ that there was some-
thing,·in the behaviour of Sometfit before his tryal‚ singular
and mysterious: and that his master likewise seemed to labour
under a secret anxiety of mind, equally surprifing. The Earl,
they pretend, said aloud in the tower‚ that the King durst not
,bring him to a tryal. Others rejeet this account as a downright
calumny, invented merely to fix a black and cruel imputation
on that Prince's memory: or affirm at least that it was founded
only in popular rumour and malicious conjec‘ture. But that
‚there was more in it than conjeffimre, may be proved by un-
doubted authority3 by some original letters of Sir Francis Belem,
then Attorney—General‚ and particularly employed in this very
affair. Those letters have, Ι think, escaped the observation of
*all our writers: I shall therefore quote from them such paffages
