q Prepared, but not used.

tions, we do in first place condole with all our loving subjects ofEng- ς j

land, for the loss of their so virtuous and excellent Qucens being a
Prince that we always found a dear sister, yea a mother to our self in many&¹
her actions and advices. A Prince, whom we hold aud behold as an excellent
pattern and example to imitate in many her royal virtues and parts of govern— -
ment, and a Prince whose days we could have wished to have been prolonged ς s
we reporting out selvcs not only to the testimony of our roy-al heart, but to
the judgment of all the world, whether there ever appeared in us any ambi·
tious or impatient delire to prevent God's appointed time. Neither are we
so partial to our own honour, but that we do in great part ascribe this our>
most peaceable and quiet entrance and coming to those our crownsg nemun-
der the bleffing of almighty God, and our undoubted right, to the fruit of
her Maiesty's peaceable and quiet government‚ accustoming the people· to all
loyalty and obedience. As for that which concerneth our solves, we would
have all our loving subjeets know, that we do not take so much gladness and
contentment in the devolving of these kingdoms unto our royal person, fot
any addition or increase of glory‚ power or richeS, as in this, that it is sb
manifest an evidence unto us (especially the manner of it considered) that we ·
stand (though unworthy> in God's favour, who hath put more means into out >
hands to reward our friends and servants, and to pardon and obliterate inju-
ries, and to comfort and relieve the hearts ancl estates of our pcople and loving
ffibjects, and chiefly to advance the holy religion and church of almighty
God, and to deserve well of the christian commonwcalth. And more
especially we cannot but gratulate and rejoice in this one point, that it harh
pleased God to make us the instrument, and, as it were, the corner stone,
to unite these two mighty and warlike nations of England and Scotland into
one kingdom. For although these two nations are scituate upon the conti-
nent of one issand, and are undividcd either by scas or mountaius‚ or by di· ·
versity of language3 and although our neighbour kingdoms of Spain and
France have already had the happiness, to be reunited in the several mem· ⁴
bers of those kingdoms formerly disjoined ; yet in this issand it appeareth not ·
in the records of any true history, no nor scarcely in the conccit of any fabu-
lous narration or tradition, that this whole issand of Great Britain was ever
united under one sovereign Prince before this day. Which as wc cannot but
take as a singular honour ancl favour of God unto our selves: so we may
conceive good hope that the kingdoms of Chrillendom standing distributed
and ,countcrpoised‚ as by this last union they now are3 it will bc a foundation
of the universal peace of all christian Princes, and that now the strife that
lhall remain between them, {hall be but an emulation who shall govern best,
and most to the weal and good of his people.
