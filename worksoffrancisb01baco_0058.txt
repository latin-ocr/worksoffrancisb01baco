together he had been methodizing, akering, polishing; till
he had laboured the whole into a series of aphorismS‚ as it now
appears. Of all his writings this seems to have undergone the,
strictest revision, and to be finished with the severest judgment.
Indeed the form into which it is cast admits of nothing foreign,
of nothing merely ornamental. The lights and embellishments
of imagination‚ the grace and harmony of stile, are rejected
here, as beauties either superfluous, or of an inferior natureg
The Author has besides made use of several terms in a new and
peculiar sense, which may have discouraged some readerS, asir.
has made others imagine them equally unintelligible with the.
horrors of a vacuum, the quiddities, and substantial form,
of the philosophy which he attempted to discredit: and
therefore, of all his writings it has been the least read, or un·
derstood. It was intended asa more useful, a more extensive ⁴

of general use to human life. This he proposed, by turning
our attention from notions to thing83 from those subtle and.
frivolous speculations that dazzle‚ not enlighten, the under--
standing, to a sober and senfible investigation of the laws and
powers of nature, in a way becoming fages who make truth
and information the sole aim of their enquiries. In order to
this, his first endeavour was to weed out of the mind such er-
rors as naturally grow in it, or have been planted there, by
education, and cherished by the influence of men, whose wri-
tings had long claimed a right of prescription to rule and mislead
mankind. To a mind thus prepared for instruction, hc pro-
poses the second and scientifical part of his scheme, the true
method of interpreting nature, by fa& and observation ; by
sound and genuine InduHiom widely differing from that puerile
art which till then had solely prevailed in philosophy. Ilis
requires a sufficient, an accurate colleffion of instances, ga-
thered with sagacity and recorded with impartial plainness, on
both fides of the question : from which, after viewing them in
all poffible lights‚ to be sure that no contraditstory instances
