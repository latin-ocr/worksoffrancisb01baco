Aristode, Ramm, Patricius, Bruno, Severi7ms‚ to name‘fso

learning, who had long reigned as absolutely over the opinions
of men, as his restless pupil had of old affected to do over
their persons. But these writers invented little that was valu‘-

things in him. And as to the real improvements made'ih
some parts of natural knowledge before our author appeared,
by Gilbert, Plarvey, Copernicns, Father Paul, and some few
others, they are well known, and have been deservedly cele-
