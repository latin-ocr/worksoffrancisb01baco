CERTrrrcATE oF TH'EeoMMrssfoNERs·

οξ the work we have ιιι hand eoneurring in an points material, we thouglm
our selves so much the more bound to resott to the infallible and original.-
grounds of nature and common re'alon, and freeing our selv es from the lead-

mg or milleading of οκ3ιιιρ1ο3, ω infi'st and fix our eonst'derations upon the
individual business in hand, without wandring or dilcourses.1t' leemed
therefore unto us a matterdemonstrati-ve by the light of reason, that w e w ere
ih first place to begin with- the remotiori and abolition of. all manner of hostile,

envious, or malign laws on either side, being ιιι themselves mere ternporary,
and now by time become ἀιι-εᾶΙγ contrary to our present most happ) estarc5.
w hich lawa, as' they are already dead in force and vigour, so w e thought fit
now to· wilh them buriedf ιιι oblivion3 that by. the utter extinguishment οῖ
the memory of discords past, we may avoid all seeds of relapse'v mto discor-ds
t'o come. Secondly‚ as matter of nature not unlike the former, we entered?
into consideration of sueh limitany constitutions as served but for to obtain a.
form of justice betw cen subicere under sev eral MonarchS, and did ιἰι the very
grounds and motii es of them presuppose meurs ons and intermixt‘nre of ho

stility: All w hieh oecas ons as they are m thennelx es now vaniffied and done
away, so we w issi the abolition and cessation thereos to be declared Third—

ly, for so much as the principal degree to union is communion and pattici*-
parion of mutual eonimodities and benefits‚ it appeared to us to folloxx next
in order, that the commeree between both. nations be let open and free, ίο
33 the commodities and provifions of either may pass and' flow to and fro,

’ vaithout any stops- or obsttufflons, into the veins of the whole body, for the

better sustentation and comfort of all the parts: with cantion nex-,crthelcss
that the vital nourishment be not so drawn into one part, as it may endanger
a consumption and withering of the other. Fourthly, after thc commu-
nion and participation by commerce, which can extend but to the transmiss'lom

· of such commodities as are moveable, personal and transtrory, there succeeds

ed naturally that other degree, that there be made a mutual endowment
and donation of either realm towards other of the abilities and capacitics to
take and enioy things which are permanent, real and fixed ‚ as names) , free-

froid and 1n11e11tance and the like: And that as well the internal and κ1τ31
veins of blood be opencd from interruption and obstrufflon ιιι making opedi-

gree, and claiming by descent, as the external and elemental teins of paflage
and commerce, with reservation neverthelels unto the due time of such abi-
Lines and capaciaies only, as no power on earth ean confer without time and
education. And lastly, because the perfectiori of this blcss'ed work consisteth
in the union, not only of the solid parts of the estate, but also in the spirit
and finews of the same, which are the laws and government which never-
theless arc already perfestly united in the head, but require 3 further time to
be united in the buli< and frame ofthe whole body3 in contemplation hereof
we did conceive that the first step thereunto was to provide, that the justice
of either realm should aid and assist, and not frustrate and interrupt the justice
of the other, specially in sundry cases ctimina13 so that either rcalm may
not be abused by malefaCtors as a fiaiistuary or place of refuge, to avoid the
condign punishment of their crimes and offences All which several points,

- as we account thern, summcd up and pur together, bnt 33 a degree or mid-

dle term to the perfecffion of this bleffed worl<3 so yet we conceivcd them
to make a just and fit period for our present consultation and proceeding.
And for so much a< concerneth the manner of our proceedingS‚ we may
xtuly make this attestation unto out sclvcs, that as the marl< we {hot at was
