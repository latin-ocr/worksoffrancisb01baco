MASTER oF THE WARDS. 67

causes too long upon continuantes of liverics after thc parties are come of
full age, which serveth but to waste the parties in suit, confideriug the de-
crees cannot be perpetual, but temporary ς and therefore controversscs here
hagdled, arc seldom put in peace, till they have past a trial and decision in
ot er courts.

Fon the third, which is the subject at latge3 his Maiesty hath taken
into his princely care, the unnecelsary vexations of his people by feodaries,
and other inferior ministers of like nature, by colour of his tenures; of
which part I say nothing for the present, because the parties whom it con-
cerns, are for the most part absent: but order {hall be given, that they {hall
give then· attendance the 'last day of the-term, then to understand further his
Maiesty's gracious pleasure. ,

’ ὙΗυε much by his Majesty's comr'nandments now we may procced to
the business of the court.

Dire&ions for the Master of the Ward8‚ to observe
ἡ for his Majesty's better service, and the general

’ good.

¹ 1RST, that he take :in acco‘unt how his Majcsty’s last instruffions

have been pursucd; and of the increase of benefit accrucd to his

· Maiesty thereby‚ and the proportion thereos.

„WHERUN first in general it will be good to cast u'p εἰ year's benefit,
viz. from February 1610, which is the date of the instructions under the
great scal, to February 161 1 ς and to compare the total with former years
before the instructions, that the trec may appear by the fruit', a‘n'd it may
be seen how much his Majesty‘s profit is redoubled or increased by that
course.

SsscoNDLY, It will not b'e amiss t'o' compute n‘ot only the yearly be-
nefit, but the number of wardssiips granted that year, and to compare that
with the number of former year-53 for though the number be a thing
casual, yet if it bc apparently less than in former years, then it may be
justly doubted, that men take advantage upon the last clause in the in-
structions (of exceptions of wards concealed) to praeuse delays and mis-
finding of offices, which is a thing most dangerous.

THIRDLY, In particular it bchoveth to perul'e and review the bargains
madesand to consider the rateS‚ (mens estates being things'‚ which fot
the »most part cannot bc hid) and thereby to disccrn what iniprovcments
and good husbandry hath been used, and how much thc King harh more
now when the whole benefit is supposed to go to him, than he had when
¹three, parts of the bencfit went to the committce. ’

F nunu-rm, lt is requifite to take consideration what comntissions have
been granted for eopyholds for lives, which are cxccpred by the instructions
ftom being leased, and what profit hath been raised thereby.

‚ Tuus much for the time past, and upon view of these accountS, ras
dabit corbelium, for further order to be taken,
