THE EARL OF ESSEX'.

Yze 'matters laid to my Lamia« (υἷας-ε.

:THE matters wherewith my Lord was charged ’were of two sevcrallee charge.
naturus 3 of an higher, and of an inferior degree of offcncc. ¹

THE former kind purported great and hiuh contempts and points of
mifigovernancc in his office of her Maiesty’s lienteum and grovernout οἵ
her rcalm of Ireland ; and in the trust and authority thereby to him corn-
qiu-redi

0 THE latter contained divers notorious ettors and neglecls of duty, as
vell in his government as otherwise.

, Tun great contempts and points of misgovernment and mal-versatim
in his office, were articulate into three hcads.

· · ccedcd contrary to his directions, and the whole defign of his em- ΗΕΒ·
ployment; whereof ensued the consumption of her Maiesly's army,

τε treasure and provis10ns‚ and the cvidcnt peril of that kingdom.

» 11. THE second was the dilhonourable and dangerous treaty held, and

‚l cess'ation concluded with the same arch-rebel Zyrone.

⁴· 111. THE third was his contemptuons leaving his gmernmem, contrary
to her Majesty's absolute mandate under her hand and ligne-t, and in a
time of so imminent and instant danger.

Fon the first, it had two part33 that her Majcsty's resolution and direc-
tion was precise and absolute for the northern prosecution‚ and that the
same direcrion was by my Lotd‚ in tcgard of the joui-ney to Munster‚
wilfully and contemptuoussy broken.

entered into a most christian and magnanimous resolution to leave no fa- {mim am!
culty of her regal power or policy unimployed for the redue‘tion of that abs0¹¹³¹⁰s⁴⁴9f
people‚ and for the supptessing and utter quenching of that flamc of re- ἓᾷξζζζξωζη
bellion, wherewith that country was, and is wastcd: whereupon her Ma-
jesty was pleased to take knowledge of the general conceit, how the for-
mer making and managing of the ae'tions there had been mixed, upon two
exceptions3 the one, that the proportions of forces which had been there
maintained and continued by supplies, were not sufficient to bring the
prosecutions to a period: the other, that the prosecutions had been also
inter-mixed and interruptcd with too many tempor-izingtreaties, whereby
the rebel did not only gather strength, bnt also find his strength more
and more, so as ever such smothers broke forth again into greater flames,
Which kind of discourses and objections, as they were entertained in a
populat kind of obser-vatim, so were they ever chiefly patronized and appre-
hended by the Earl, both upon former times and occafions, and now last
when this matter was in deliberation. So as her Maiesty to acquir her honour
and regal funffion, and to give this satisfaffion to het sclf and others, that
she had left no way untried‚ resolvcd to undertake the action with a royal
army and puiffant forces, under the leading of some principal noblemam in
such sort, that as far as humane discourse might discern, it might be hoped

that by the expedition of a summe} things might be brought to that state, als
