lighten it in all its views. As the name of Sir Edward Coke will

occur oftner than once in this history, and as he stood in parti-

cular competition to Βαεοη, Ι beg leave to dwell a little longer

on hischaraffoer. In his pleadings he was apt to insult over mi—

sery. Of this we have a detestable instance in his behaviour to

Sir Walter Ralezjgh. He inveighed against that brave man on

his tryal with all the bitterness of cruelty, andin a stile of such isigiifffk'
abandoned railing as bordered almost on fury: I wish I could ²⁰7’ ἃς·
not add, that this bitterness, this intemperance of tongue, seem

to be the genuine effusions of his heart ἦε. He conversed it
seems more with books than men3 and among the latter,

with those only to whom he could dictate and give the

law. The consequence of which waS‚ that his conversa-

Buckingham’s brother to a match with his daughter: in the
height of his favour, he had rejedted the same proposal with
soom. His profound skill in the common law has been uni-

* The offices of Attorney and Solicitor-General have been rocks upon which many
aspiring Lawyers have made stiipwreck of their virtue and human nature. Some of
those Gentlemen have afted at the bar as if they thought themselves, by the duty of
their places, absolved from all the obligations of nuth, honor, and decency. But
their names are upon record, and will be transmitted to after-ages with those cha—
