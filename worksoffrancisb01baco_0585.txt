IN PRAISE oF Q. ELIZABETH'.

standing the oppofition so great, the support so weak, the season so unpropet3
yet, Ii'ay, b'ecause it was a religion wherein {he was nourilhed and brought
up3 a religion that freed her subjefis from pretence of foreign powers, and
indeed the true religi0n3 she brought to pass this great work with success
worthy so noble a resolution. See a Queen, that when a deep and secret con-
spiracy was plotted against her sacred person, praCiiscd by subtile instruments,
embraced by violent and desperate humours, strengthened and bound by
vonis and sacramentS, and the same was revealed unto her (and yet the nature
οξ the affairs required further ripcning before the apprehension of any of the
parties) was content to put herself into the guard of the divine providence‚
and her own prudencc, to have some of the conspirators in her eyes, to suffer
them to approach to her person, to take a petition of the hand that was con-
jured for her death3 and that with stich majesty of counremnce, such mildness
aad screnity of gesture, such art and impreffion of words, as had been suffi-
cient tohave reprcst and bound the hand of a conspirator, if hc had not been
discovered. Lastly, see a Quem, that when'hcr realm was to have been in-
vaded by an army, the preparation whcrcof was like the travel of an elephant,
the' 'provisions were infinite, the setting forth whereof was the terror and
wonder of Europa it was not seen that her cheat, her fassaion‚ her ordinary
manner was any thing altered: not a cloud of that storm did appear in that
countenance wherein peace doth ever ihine3 but with excellent ass‘urance, and
advised seeursty, she inspired her council‚ animated her nobility, redoublcd
the courage of her peoplc, still having this noble apprehension‚ not only that
stic would coznnunicatc her fortune with them, but that it was she that would
protest them, and not they her: which ihc testified by no less demonstration
thnn' her presence in camp. Therefore, that magnanimity that neither feareth
greatness οῖ’ almathan, noi· the views of conspirators, nor the power of
enemy, is inore ‘than lieroical.
Pon coziiciiipt of profit, consider her offers, consider her purchases.
. She harh reigned in a most populous, and wealthy peace, her peoplc greatly
multiplied, wealthily appointed, and singular-ly devoted. She wanted not
the exampie of the power of her arms in the memorable voyagcs andin-
vafions prosperoussy made and atchieved by fundi-y her noble progenitors.
she harh not wanted pretences‚ as well of claim and right, as of quai-sel
and rcvenge. She hath reigned during the minority of some of her neigh-
bour princeS, and during the faelions and divisions of their peoplc upon deep
and irreconcilable quari-cis, ancl during the imbracing greatness of some
one that hatli made himself so weak through too much burthen, as others
a‘re.tlirougli decay of strength3 and yet see her sitting as it were within the
compass of her [ands. Scotland‚ that doth as it were eclipse her issand3

the justriess of her pretences, and the rareness of her opportunity 5 she hath
' continued her first mind, ssic harh made the poss'essions which she received

peace that harh stained all viCtories.
