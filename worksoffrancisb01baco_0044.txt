discovered in them, we must own that it required no common>
penetration to be mistaken with so great an appearance of pro-

ΗΟΒΑΒΤ being advanced to the place of Chief Justice of the'
C on mon Pleas, Sir Francis Bacon succeeded him as Attor'ney
Genera! m 1 ὁ 1 3 3 about three months after the death of 'his kin&
man and enemy the Lord Treasurer Salisbmy .· a minister fer-³
tile in expeti ients for supplying his master's wants‚ and well*
acquainted with the temper of England: a man of dexterity,
craft, and infflgue, rather than a great man. The office that

He owns, in one of his letters to the King, that it was worth
to him 6000 l. a year-3 and his employment ofRegister tosthe
Stat-Chamber‚ which Ι mentioned above, now brought him
in 1600 l. a year more. By what fatality was it that so ex-

would needs be his preceptor: and it must have been a scene
altogether new and ridiculous, to see the Sovereign of three-
kingdoms daily instrusting, in the first elements of grammat-3?
