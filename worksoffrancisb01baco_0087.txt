LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. lxv

accomplifh: and the Learned of all countrics from his clava
have been only labouring some separate or' leffer parts of tlim
amazing edifice, which ages to corne may not see finissied ac-
cording to the model left them by this one Man.

Sum, and so unlimited were his views for the univcrstil ad—
vancement of science3 the noble aim to which he direcied all
his philosophie labours. What Caestzr said, in complemenf, to
Delly may, with stri& justice, be applied to him3 that it Was
more glorious to have extended the limits of human wit, than
to have enlarged the bounds of the Roman world. Sir Francis Ba*-
con really did so: a truth acknowledged not only by the greatest
private names in Europe, but by all the public societies of its
most civilized nations. Frmzce, Italy, Germany, Britain, Ι
may add* even Ruffla, have taken him for their leader, and sub·
mitted to be governed by his institutions. The empire he has
ereaed in the learned world is as universal as the free use of
realbn: and One must continue, till the Other is no more.
