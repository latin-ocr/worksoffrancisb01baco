(as ‚we now are capable of it) the mind suffer-eth from inferior natures ; but
111311 belief it suffer-eth from a spirit, which it holdeth superior, and more
authorized than it self.

,To conciude3 the prejudice hath been infinite, that both divine and hu-
man knowledge hath received by the intermingling and tempering of the
one with tne other 3 as that which hath filled tl‘1e one full of hereiics, and the
qthet full of speculative fistions and vanities.

‘Birt now there are again, which in a contrary extremity to those which
gavero contemplation an over—large scope, do ‚offer too great a restraint to
. natural and lawful knowledge3 being unjustly jealous that every reach and
depth of knowledge wherewith their conceits have not been acquainted,
spould be too high an elevation of man’s wit, and a scarehing and ravelling
ς’ὸᾳ fat into God's secret33 an opinion that ariseth either of *envy (which is
prbud weakness, and to be censured and not confuted) or else of a deceitful
fign licity. , For if they mean that the ignorance of asecond cause doth make
“ e ,more devoutly to dcpend upon the providence of God, as supposing the
ς ,eststo come immediately from his hand ς Ι demand of them, as Job de-
ffissnded of his friends, Wllyou lye for (iod, as man willfor man'to gra-
ttsfyshim? But if any man, without any sinister humour, doth indeed
make doubt that this digging further and further into the mine of naturai
, knowledge, is a thing without example, and uncommended in the scriptutes,

og fruitless; let him remember and be instruited: for behold it was not that
βψς light of natural knowledge, whereby man in paradise was able to give
tinto ,every living creature a name according to his propriety, which gave
occasion to the fall5 but it was an aspiting desire to attain to that part of
n'noral knowledge, which defineth of good and evil, whereby to dispute
God’s commandments, and not to depend upon the revelation of his will,
'which was the original temptation. And the first holy recor-ds, which with-
in those brief memorials of things which passed before the flood, entered
few} things as worthy to be registi-ed, but only linages and propagations, yet
hevertlielei's honour the remembrance of the inventor both of musici< and
works in metal. Affofis again (who was the reporter) is said to have been
'seen in all the Egyptian learning, which nation was early and leading in
siissattjer of knowledge. And Salomon the King, as out of a branch of his
*wisdom extraordinarily petitioned and granted from God, is said to have
{written a natural history of all that is green, stom the cedar to the moss

(which is but a rudiment between putrefaction and an herb) and also ofall

that Ilveth and moveth. And if the book of Job bc turned over, it will be
found to have much asperiion of natural philosophy. N ay, the same Solomon
J'the King affirmeth dii-eeily, that the glory of God is to conceal a thing,

'but the glory of the K ing is to find tt out, as if according to the innocent
, play 'of children, thc divine Majcsty took dclight toliide his works, to the
'end to have them found outa foi· in naming the King he intendeth man,

mandment of wits and means, alluding also to his own person, being truly
one ‘of those clear-est burning lamps, whereof himself speaketh in another
place, when he saith, Thesjn'rit of man is as the lamp ofGod, where-„sith
