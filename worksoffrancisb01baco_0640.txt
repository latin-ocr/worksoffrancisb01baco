68 DIRECTIONS FOR THE MASTER OF'WARDS.

Fon the time to come, first it is fit that the master of the wards, being a
meziner person, be usually present as well at the treaty and bearing of the bar-
zain, tas at the concluding, and that he take not the business by report. ,ar-r
υ θ5116011 ῡωῡ, 11711111 suit is made, the &formation by survcy auct-dt>
mlffion is but one image, but the way were by private 'diligence to be r'c‘ally
informed: Ncithet >is it hard for a person that liveth in an inu of court,
where there bc understandlng men of every county of England, to obtain
by care certain information.

ΤΗΙ RDLY, This kind of premisc of preferring-the next a-kin, doth much
obscure the information, which before by competition pf divers did better
appear3 and therefore it may be necessary for the master of the'wards
sometimes to direct letters to some persons near the ward living, and to
take certificate from them3 it being always intended the subject be* rtot
racked too high, and that the nearest friends that be found iu religion, and·
like to give the ward good education, be preferred.

FoURTHLY, That it be examined carefully whether the ward's revenues
confist of copyholds for lives, which are not to be comprized in the leafe,
and that there bc no neglect to grant commistions for the same, and-H

 

the master take order to be certified of the profits of former courts
by the ward’s anoestor, that it may be a precedent and dircffion fot the
missioners. ‘tf‘
Fmrnrr, That the master make account every six months (the state ap}-
points one in the year) to his Maiesty 3 aud that when he bringeth 1³11&ng
of grants of the body for his Majesty’s lignature, he bringeth, 3 scheda&
of the truth of the state of every one of them, (as it harh appearcdtohisa
by information) alid acquaint his Maiesty both with the rates aud stanes„

person of the wards 111 every county, and their education5 but- of thuin*
houses, woods‚ grounds, and estate5 and the same to certify that the §zom-
mittees may be held in some awe, and that the bleffing of theafpoomlnt-

SEcoNDLY‚ for the suitors; that there be a straight examinatori con-
eerning the raifing ancl multiplicatiori of sees in that court, which is mueh
scandalized with opinion thereos, and all exacTted fees put down. ,
THIRDLY, for the subjeets at large3 that the vexation of ‘escheatoss
