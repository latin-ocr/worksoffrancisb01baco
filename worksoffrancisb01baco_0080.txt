c'ommotion in the learned world. Τ110 univerfity of Paris took
th 0 alar m body, and cr) 0(1 out against this attempt as destruc-
tiv e of ll 00001 learning), and of fatal tendency ro teligion itself.
The affair was broughtD before the parliament3 and appeared of
J aun-011, tom so much consequence to fra zcis the First‚ that he would needs
Ν p'² ἰώ take it under his own immediate cognizance. The edict 1s still
extant, which declares Ramus insolent, impudent and a lyar.

scrable Author is solemnly interdiested from transcribing, even
fro' n reading his own compositions!

We, might frorn 110100 be led to imagine, that when the
authority of an antient philosopher was held so sacred, philos&
phy itself must have been thoroughly u 10101 stood and cultivated
w 1t¹1 1111001101 on success; but the attachment of those Doctors
was to a name, not to truth, or valuable science: and our Au-

Bffiffis Α- thor very justly compares them to the Olympic Wrestlers‚' who
thegffi abstained from necessary labourS, that they might be fit for such
as were not so. Under their management, it was a philosophy
of words and notioris, that seemed to exclude the study of na-
ture3 that instead of enquiring into the properties of bodies,
into the laws of motion by which all effeas are produced,
was conversant only in logical definitions‚ distinetions, and ab·
straaions, utterly barren and unprodufflve of any advantage to
mankind. The great aim of those solemn triflers was rather to
perplex a dispute than to clear up any point of useful disqui-
sition3 to· triumph over an enemy, than to enlarge the know—
ledge, or better the morals of their followers. So that this cap-
tious philosophy was a real obstacle to all advances in found
learning, human and divine. After it had been adopted into
the christian theology, far from being of use to explain and as-
certain myster-ies, it served to darken and render doubtful the
most neceffary truth's; by the chicanery of argu mentation with
which it supplied each sea, in defence of their peculias and fa-
vourire illufions. To so extravagant a height did they carry
their idolatry of Aristotle, that some of them discovered or
imaoined they d1scoxered 111 1113 writings, the doctrine of the
Trinity3 that others published formal dissertations to prove the
certainty of his salvation, tho a heathen: and that a Pitriarch
of Venice is said to have called up the Devil expressly‚ in order
