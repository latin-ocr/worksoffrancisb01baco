LORD CHANCELLOR BACON.

hasten forward his destruetion. He was sentenced by the coun-‘

his liberty, upon his expresfing a perse& resignation to her
pleasure3 but withal advised him to be his own keeper. His
seeming repentance was of short duration; for upon the Qeen' 3
refusal to grant him the sarm of sweet wineS, which he had very

him by Sir Edward Coke, the Attorney General, and by
