‘²‘ believe them superior to mankind, and we never have the con-
‘·‘ solation to see them.'’ Among his countrymen‚ the names,
alone, of those who have adopted his notionS‚ and proceeded
on his plan, are his highest encomium. To pass over a long
line of philosophers, all illustrious; he reckons in the list of his
followers a Boyle, a Locke, a Newton himself.
Ra‘zvlffsLife ONE singularity there was in his temperament‚ not easily to
⁰ Μ’ be accounted for: in every eclipse of the moon, whether he·
observed it or not, he was certainly seized with a sudden fit of
sainting3 which left him, without any remaining weakness, as·
Eveg,.„0f soon as the eclipse ended. He was of a middling stature} his

age3 his eye lively and penetrating3 his whole appearance ve*
nerably pleafing: so that the beholder was insenfibly drawn-v to
love, before he knew how much reason there was to admire*
him. In this respect, we may apply to my Lord Βαίου what

a facility that was perfeffly natural 3 or the dexterity of the>
habit concealed every appearance of art: a happy versatility of
genius, which all men wish to arrive at, and one or tvm, once
in an age, are seen to possess. In public, he commanded the
attention of his hearers, and had their affeffi'tions wholly in his
power. As he accompanied what he spoke with all the expres·
sion and grace of astion, his pleadings, that are now perhaps
read without emotion‚ never failed to awaken in his audience
the several paffions he intended they should “feel. This is not
a picture of him drawn from fancy: it is copied, and that too
