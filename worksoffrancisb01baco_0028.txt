appearances‚ he met with no preferment from that Qeen ari—-

as it will discover to us the true genius of those ministers, who
pretending to merit themselves, are jealous of it in all other
men: who are equally poor-spirited and aspiring.

THE whole court was at this time rent into faecions, headed
on one part by the Earl of Effex3 on the other by the Cecils,
father and son. Effex was then in all the flower of his youth,
and remarkable for the gracefulness of his person. In his ,Πει-Δ
