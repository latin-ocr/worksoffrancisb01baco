HIS MAJESTY’S‘FIRST‘ COMING' IN. 47
’ · ANo‘rflErt great cause of our just rejoicing is, the affurcd hope that we
conceive, that whereas our kingdom ofIreland hath been so long time torn

and afflictet! with the miserics of warS, the making aud prosecuting of which
>‘wars 113111 eost such 311 infinite deal of blood and treasure of our realm of

Englaniss to be spilt and consumed thereupon} 'we shall be able, through
God's* favour and affistance‚ to put a spcedy and an honourable end to those
viram. And it is our princely defign and full purpose and resolution, not on-
ly to reduce that nation from their rebellio'n and revolt, but also to 10013131
them from their barbarous 1113311015, 10 justice and the fear of God3 and to*
populate,³ plant, and make civil all the Ρ1ον111005111 that kingdom: which 31·
so beingssan 3611011 11131 1101 any of our noble progenitore», Kings of England5
harh ever had the happiness throughly to prosecute and aecomphlh, we take
somuch‘ to heart as we are persuaded it is oue of the chief causeS‚ for the which
God-hath brought us to the imperial crown ofthese kingdoms.

v F tm THE n, we cannot but take great comfort in the state and correspon-
denec which we now stand in of peace and unity with all christian Princes,
andot‘herwise, of quietness ancl obedience of our own people atv home:

- whereby we {hall not need to expose that our kingdom of England to any
q'uarrcl = or war, but rather have occasion to preserve them in peace and tran-
quility‚ and opeuness of trade with all foreign nations.

· [ΑΜ-ιγ and pdneipally, we cannot but take unspcakable comfort in thc
great and wonderful consent and unity‚ joy ancl alaerhy, whercwith our
loving subjee’rs of our kingdom of England have received and acknowledged
u's their natural and lawful King and Governour‚ according to our most clear
andzundoubted right, in so quiet and settled manner, as if we had been long
ago declared and established successor, and had taken all mens oaths and
homages3 greater and more pcrfect unity and readiness could not have been.
For confidering with our senes, that notwithstanding difference of religion,-
or any other fiction, and notwithstanding our absence so far off, and not-
withstanding the sparing and reservcd communicating of one another's mindsz
310131103110111331111110015 met in 0110 thought and voice, without any the
least disturbance or interruptim, yea, hesitation or doubtfulness, or any
111οψ 111010οῖ 3 we cannot but aeknowledge it is 3 great work of God, who
