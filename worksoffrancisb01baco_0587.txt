as it were the contra& of 3 private man. To conclude, 111616 111311 you

find moneys levicd upon failts of Iands, alicnation (though not of the an- ,

616111 patrimony) yet of the rich and commodioris purchases aud perquifitcs
of the crown only, because 1116 will not be grievous and burthensome to
the peoplc. This 116311116, so innocently levied, so honourably gathered
and raised, with such tenderness to the subject, without any basencss or
dryncss at all3 how harh it been cxpended and imploycd? Vthre be the
wastefui buildings, and the exorbitant and prodigal donatich, the sump-
1110113 diffipations in pleasurcs, and vain ostentations which wc find have
exhausted 1116 coffcrs of so many Kings? 11 13 1116 honour of her house, the
royal remunerating of her servantS, the preservation of her pcople and
state, the pi-otet‘tion of her suppliants and 311163, 1116 cncounter, breaking
ancl defeating the cnemics of 1161· 1631111, that hath been the only porcs and
pipcs whereby the treasure 113111 issued. Hath it bccn the finews of a bles-
sedrand prosper-ons peace? Hath 1116 bought her peace? Hath 111616111 the
King of Spa-in money upon some cavillation not to be repeated, and so
bought 1113 favour? And 1131111116 given large pensions to corrupt his council?
No, but 1116 113111 used the most honourable diverfion of troubles that can
116-111 the world. She 113111 kept 1116 fire from her own walls by secking
to quench it in her ncighbours. That poor brand of the state of Burgundy,
and that other of the crown of France that remaincth, 11311 been 111 311163
but for the ready fountain of her continual benignity. For the honour of
116111011Γ6 11 is well known, that almost the universal manners of 1116 1111163
110111 incline to a certain parfimony and dryncss in that kind of expence:
51611116 retaineth the ancient magnificence, the allowancc as full, the charge
greater than in tirnc of her father, or any King before: the books appear,
the computation will not flatter. And for the remunerating and reward-
ing of her servants, and the attendancc of the 601111, 161 3 man cast 31111
sum up all the books of gists, fec-farmS, lcascs and custodies that have
pass'ed her bountiful hands. Let him consider again what a number of
commodious and gainful offices hcrctoforc bestowed upon men of other
education and profess'iom have been withdrawn and conferred upon her court.
Let him rcmcmbcr, what a number of o'ther gifrs disguiscd by other 11311163,
but in effe& as good as money given out of her coffcrs, haye been granted
byv hcr3 and 116 will conclude, that 1161 royal mind is far above her means.
The other benefits of her politiek‚ clement, and gracious governmcnt to-
wards the subjee‘ts are without number; the state of justice good, notwith-
standing the great subtilty and liumo'rous affcffions of these times; the
secutity of peace greater than can be described by that vcrse3

The opulcncy of the peace such, 33 if you have rel'p‘cst (to' take one sign‘
for many) to the number of fair house< that have been built fincc her
reign, as Augustus said, that he had recencd the city of brick, and left
it of marblc5 so 1116 may say, 1116 received it a rcalm of cottages, and
harh made 11 3 rcalm of palaccs : The state of traffick great and rich: the

castonis, notwithstanding these war< aud interruptions, not sallcn: many -
