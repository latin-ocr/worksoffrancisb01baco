Α. « arguments, any manner of altereation or strife of word53 nor in our resolutions
'⁴ .- any variety ordiviston of votes, bnt the whole pass'cd with an unanimity and
uniformity of consent: and yet so, as we suppose, there was never in anv
consultation greater plainness and liberty of speech, argnment and (lebate,

&the business required, rest so upon our own sense and opinions, but we did
wiso aid and assist our febres, as well with the reverend opinion of judges and
v‘ussperssons of great science and authority in the laws‚ and also with the wisdom
5{trid¹exper‘ience of merchants, and men expett in commerce. In all which
