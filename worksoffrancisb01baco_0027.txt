tr'uly noble, or of lasting utility to mankind. Inviolably at-
tached to his Mistress‚ he served her with equal fidelity and
success: and had the fingular felicityto promote the good os
his country by the same arts that he employed to gratify the
inclinations of his sovereign.

*THE glory of this Princess will receive a new lustre by com-
paring the state of Englcmd with that of almost all other na-
tions in Europe, at the same time. It must have been no com-
