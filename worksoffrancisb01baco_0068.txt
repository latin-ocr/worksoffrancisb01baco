THE LIFE OF THE

I have acknowledged that my Lord Eacmz's History has
been taxed of partiality, and I will not diss'cmble that his
stile has been objected to, as full of affectation, full of false
eloquence. But that was the vice, not of the man, but ofthe
times he lived in: and particularly of a court that, after the
Sovereign’s example, delighted in the tinsel of wit and writing,
in the poor ingenuity of punning and quibbling. = ,

His Effays have, of all his works, been most current, and
are still very justly esteemed. Towards the close of his life he
greatly enlm-ged them both in number and Weight3 and pub..
lished them anew, not only in Englifh, but in a more uni-
versal language‚ which, 116 imagined, may preserve them as
long as books shall last. As they are intended not to amuse
but instruc& as they are neither a satire on human nature„
nor the school of scepticism3 Monfieur de Voltaire observes,—

⁰i⁵' that they have been less popular than the Maxims of Rochefozt-

cault, or the Effays of Montagne. A remark that does> my
Lord Bacon honour ; who was too great a Man to court a re*
putation from the multitude, by sacrificing to that malignity,
or indulging that curious extravagance‚ which too many
readers, Ι am afraid, expect to find gratified, even in writings
of a moral kind.

01·- the other works which he composed in this last scene of
his life, Ι forbear to make any mention here: they will be all·
enumerated in another place. Let me only observe, that no·-
thing can give a more exalted idea of the fruitfulness and vigour
of his genius than the number and nature of those writingS.
Under the discouragement of a public censure, broken in his
health, broken in his fortuneS, he enjoyed his retirement not
above five years: a little portion of time! yet he found means
to croud into· it what might have been the whole bufi—
nesS, and the glory too, of a long and fortunate life. Some of
his former pieces he methodized and enriched: several new ones
he composed, no less considerable for the greatnefs and variety
of the arguments he treated, than for his manner of treating
them. Nor are they works of mere erudition and labour, that
require little else but strength of constitution and obstinate ap-
plication: they are original efforts of genius and reflefflon, on
subjects either new, or handled in a manner that makes them
s0. His notions he drew from his own fund: and they were
