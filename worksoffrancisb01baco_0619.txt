TOUCHINGHIS-MAJE·STY⁴S STYLE, 51,

we rested wcll satisfied to respite the same, as to requireit by a& of parliament.
But being still resolved and fixcd that it may conduce towards this happy end

’ of the better uniting of the mitioris, we have thought good by, the advice of

vour council to take the same upon us by our proclamation, being a course lafe'
and free frorn any of the perils or scruples aforesaid. And therefore we do
by these presentS, publilh, proclaim, and assume to our selvcs from henceforth,
according to our undoubtcd right, the style and title of King of Great Bri.
ta'ny, France, and Ireland, and otherwise as followeth in our style formerly
used. And we do hereby straitly charge and command our chanoeHor,
and· ‘all such as have the custody of any of our seals; and all other our officcrs
an‘d subiects wlmsocver, to whom it may in any wise appertain, that from·
hen'ccforth in all commiffions, patema, writs, process'eS, grantS, records‚
instruments, iinpreffionS, sermons, and all other writings and spceches what-
soever, wherein our style is used to be set forth or recited, that our said style,
as is before by these presents declared and prescribed‚ be only used, and no
other. And because we do but now declare, that which in truth was before,
our ‘will and plcasure is, that in the computation of our reign, as to all
wri'tings orinstruments hercaftcr to be made, the same computation be taken
and made, as if we had taken upon us the style aforesaid immediately after
the deceasebof our late dear sister, And we do notify to all our subjects,
that lf any person, of what degree or condition soever he be, shall impugn
oursaid style, or derogare and detra& from the same by any arguments, spceches,
words or otherwisc; we shall procecd against him, as against an offender a·
gainst our crown and dignity, and a disturbet of the quiet and peace of our
kingdom, according to the utmost severity of our laws in that behalf. Ne-
vertheless our meaning is not, that where in any writ, pleading‚ or other re-
cord, writing, instrument or speech, it hath been used for mention to be
made of England, or the realm of England, or any other word or words
derived from the same, and not of our whole and entire style and title3 that
therein any alteration at all be used by pretext of this our proclamation, which·
w'e intend to take place only where our whole style shall be recited, and not
otherwise5 and in the other cases the ancient form to be used and observed.
