A WAR WITH SPAIN.

THE third reason (which hath some affinity with this second) is a point
comfortable to hear in the state that we now ate3 wars are generally causes
of poverty and consumption. The nature of this war you are persuaded 'will
be matter of restorative and enrich'mg5 so that if we go roundly on with
supplies and provisions at the first, the war in continuance will find it self.
That you do but point at this, and will not enlarge it.

*LAsrmss That it is not a little to be confidet-ed, that the greatness of
§jain is not only distraeted extremely, and. therefore of less force, but built
upon no very found foundations5 and. therefore they can have the less strength
by any affured and confident confederacy with France: they are in eom-
petition for Navarre‚ Milan, N aples‚ and the Franch County of Burgzcndy ,-
with the see of Rome, for Naples also5 for Portugal‚ with the right heirs
qgffthlat line5 for that they have in their Low Countrz'es, with the United
&revinces ,- for Ormus (now) with Perfia3 for Valencia‚ with the Moors
expulsed and their confederates; for the East and Wst Indies‚ with all the
world. So that if every bird had his feather, Spain would be left wonderful
paked. But yet there is a greater confederation against them than by means of
‚guy of these quarrels or titles; and that is contraeled by the fear that almost
all nations have of their ambition, whercof men sce no end. And thus much
for the ballancing of their forces.

Δ Fon the last point, which is the choiee of the designs and enterprizes‚ in
which to conduct the war; you will not now speak‚ because you {hould be
forced to descend to divers particulam, whereof some are of a more open,
pind some of a more secret nature. But that you would move the house to
jmake a selected committee for that purpose. Not to estrange the house in
any sort, but to prepare things for them, giving them power and commiss'lon
to call before them, and to confer with any martial men or others that are
not of the house, that they {hall think fit, for their advice and information:

{aad so to give an account of the business to a general committee of the whole
ouse.
