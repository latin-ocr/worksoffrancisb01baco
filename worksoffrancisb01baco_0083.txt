table treatise entitled, The Advancement of Learning. As he
intended to raisea new and last-ing structure of philosophy,

· founded not in arbitrary opinions or specious conjefitureS, but
in truth and experience, it was absolutely necessary to his
defign, first to review accurately the state of learning as it then
stood, thro all its provinces and divifions. To do this effeetu-
ally required, with an uncommon measure of knowledge, a
discernment not only exquisite ‘but universal: the whole intel-
lectual world was subjeeted to its examination and censure.
‘That he might not lose himself on a subjecit so vast and of such
variety, · he haS, according to vthe three faculties of the foul,
memory, fancy, understanding, ranged the numerous train of
arts under three great claffeS, history, poetry, philosophy.
These may be considered as the principal trunks from which
shoot forth, in prodigious diverfity, the leffer parts and branches
of seleuce. Whatever is deficient, erroneous, or still wanting
in each, he has pointed out at large: together with the pro-

=was not ourily well acquainted with every thing that had been
discovered in books before his time, and able to pronounce
critically on those discoveries: he saw clearly, and at the end
of this treatise has marked out in one general chart, the several
traets of science that lay still negleti'ted or unknown. And to
say truth, some of the most val-uable improvements since made
have grown out of the hints and notices scattered thro this
work z from which the moderns have selected, each according
to his fancy, one or more plants to cultivate and bring to per-
frition.

second part to his Instauration, and0 may be reckoned the mostg‘
considerable, was to raise and enlarge the powers of the mind,
by a more useful application of its reasoning faculty to all the
different objests that philosophy confide-rs. In this place, our
