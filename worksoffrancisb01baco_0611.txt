'oF THE STATE oF EUROPE. 43

'Ar this present the King is about to restore ‘Don Antonio King of
²¹ Portngal, whereto are grear levies and preparation.

² rF RAN C IS Duke of Argjou and of Brabant‚ for his calling and [ΜΨ 0f
quality greatly to be considered as any=Prince this day living, being secondssmham.
, person to the King his brother, and in likelihood to succecd him. There is
⁷ noted in the disposition of this Prince, a quiet mildnel‘s, giving satisfaction to
all mem faciliry of acccss and natural courtcsy3 under-standing and speech
great and eloquent; seereey more than commonly is in the French3 from
'¹ his youth always dessrous of astion, the which thing hath made him always
‘'olibwed and respeetcd. And though hitherto he hath brought to pass no

great purpose, having suffered great wanrs, and refistance both at home and

abrotid, yet by the intermeddling is grown to good cxperience, readiness and
¹ jngment‚ the better thereby able to guide and govern his affairs, both in
prae-tice, ln treaty‚ and aetion. Moreover, the diseased estate of the world
'dothso concur with thishis nenive forwardness‚ asir giveth him matter to γ
work upon : and he is the only man to be seen of all them in distress‚ or
3 desirous of alteration. A matter-ofspecial further-aneo ro all such as have
arehieved great ‘thingS‚ when they have found matter dispoled to receive
form. ’

AND there is to be found no other Prince in this part of the world so to-
xffai‘ssds and forward as the Duke, towards whom they in distress may turn
theii- eyes. We do plainly see in the most countries of Christendom so un-
&arrd-and lhaken an estate, as desireth the help of some great person, to set.
together ancl join again the pieccs asunder and out of joint. W herefore the
prffi'mprion is grear, that if this Prince continue this his course, he is likely
tdfficeome a mighty potentate: for one cnterprize failing, other will be
offered, and still men evilat ease, and desti-ons of a head and captain, will ,
ru'n' to him that is fittest to receive them. Befidcs, the French desimus to
shake off the civil wars, must needs attempt somewhat abroad. This Duke
first had intelligence with the Count Ludovic in King Charles's days, and.
an ‘enterprize to escape from the court, and ln this King's time joined with
theffifof the religion and malcontents: after was carried against them, seeketh
the'marriage with her Majesty so mighty aPrincess, as it were to marry
might with his aftivity.

ζ ΗΕ harh had practice in Germani! to be created King of Romans, made a
sudden voyage with great expedition into the Low Countries‚ now is there
again with better success than so soon was looked for.

ζ THE King of Spain, &Philip fonto charles the Fifth, about fixty years of Spainss
age, ,apr-inec of great understanding, subtle ancl aspir-ing, diligent and cruci:
This King especially harh made his bencfit of the time, where his last attempt
onPortugal deserveth exa& consideration, thereby as by the workmanlhip
to‘know the master.

J THE first success he had was at S t. Qcintin, where he got a norable hand
of‘th‘e French3 he fought to reduce the Low Countries to an absolute sub-

favour of the house of Gmst’> by means or* the Qleen-morhcr in contempla-
tion‘ofher nieceS, he beareth great sxvay. With the Pope he is so linked,
