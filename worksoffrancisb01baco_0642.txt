IN PRAISE OF KNOWLEDGE··

mon notions which we call rcalon, and the knitting of them together,
which w e call logick, are the art of ieason and studies. But they rather cast
obscurity, than gain light to the contemplation of nature. All the phi-
vlosophy of nature which is now recen ed is either the philosophy of the
Grecians, or that othei of the Alchcmists. That of the Grecians harh
the foundations m words, in ostentation‚ in confutarim, in fecis, in schodis'
in diip itations. The Grecians were (as one of tlienilelx es say eth) you Gre-
cians ever children. They knew little antiquity3 they knew (except fable's
not much above five hundred years before themselxcs. They knew but'.
small portion of the w'orld. That of the Alchemists harh the foundaiib'n
in imposture- in auricular traditions and obleuritj. It 55 as catching hold
of religion, but the principle of it is, ‘Populus vult decipi. So that 1
know no great difference between these great pliilosophers, but that th'e one
is a loud crying folly, and the other is a 55 hilperinr* folly. The one is
gathered out of a few vulgar observamus, and the other out of a few ex-
periments of a furnaee. The one never faileth to multiply words, and
the other ever faileth to multiply gold. W ho would not smilc at Aristode,
when he admireth the eternity and invariableness of the heavens, as there
were not the like in the bowels ofthe earth? Those be the confines and bor-
ders of these two kingdoms, where the continual alteration and in‘eurfion
are. The superficies nand upper parts of the earth are full of varieties.
The superficies and lower parts of the hear ens (which wecall the middle
region of the air) is full of v'ariet). There is much spirit in the one part,
that cannot be brought into mass. There is much maffy body in the
other place, that cannot be refined to spirit. The common air is as the
waste ground between the borders. who would not smile at the astro-
nomers, Imean not these few carmen which drive the earth about, but
the ancient astronomers, which fcign the moon to be the swiftest of the
planets in motion, and the rest in order, the higher the ssower3 and so
are compelled to imagine a double motion: whereas how evident··is it,
that that which they call a contrary motion, is but an abatement of mo·-
tion? The fixed stars overgo Sarum, and so in thern and the rest an is but
one motion, and the nearer the earth the ssower. A motion also whereof
air and water do participate, though much interrupted. But why dol in
a eonference of pleasure enter into these great matters, in sort that'prc‘-
tending to know much 1 should forget what is scafonablc? Pardon⁷me3
it was because all things may be indowed and adorned with speechesi- but
knowledge itself is more beautiful than any apparel of words that ean be
put upon it. And let not me seem arrogant without respest to these great
reputed authors. Let me so give every man his due, as 1 give time his
due, which is to dilcover truth. Many of these men had greater wits
far above mine own, and so are many in the univerfities of Europen this
day. But alas, they learn nothing there but to believe: first to believe
that others know that which they ε’1ετιο55ῑ not3 and after themselves know
that which they know not. But indeed facility to believe, impatience to
doubt, temerity to answer, glory to know doubt to contradict, end to
gain, ssoth to search, leeking things in words, testing in part of nature,
these, and the like, have been the things 55 luch hare forbidden the happy
match betw reen the mind of man, and the nature of things· ‚ and in place}
thereos haze married it to vain notions, and blind experiments: And what}
the posterity and issue of so honourable a match may be, it is not hard
