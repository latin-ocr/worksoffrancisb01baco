LORD CHANCELLOR BACON.

promoting the match, he had just been labouring to disappoint.
On such trivial accidents do the fortunes of Ministers depend z and
to such little and snameful arts is ambition often obliged to stoop.
Nor even thus did he presently regain his credit with Buck-

mercy of a King's minim, young, and giddy with his eleva-

reconciled at last 3 and their friendlhip‚ if obsequiousness in
one to all the humours of the other deserves the name of
friendship, continued without interruption for some years:
while Bzcckingham went on daily to place and displace the
great officers of the Crown, as wantonness of fancy, or anger,
or interest led him3 to recommend or discountenance every
private person who had a suit depending in any court, just as
he was influenced 3 to authorize and prote& every illegal pro-
jest, that could serve most speedily to enrich himself or his
kindred. In a word he became formidable even to the master
who had raised him from the dust, and who should have still
awed him by his authority: and this amidst the diffipation of
a life, given up to idle amusen1e11t8‚ or sullyed with criminal
leasures.

p IN the beginning of 1619, Sir Francis Bacon was created
Lord High Chancellor of England, and shortly after Baron of
V erulam3 which title he exchanged, the year following, for
that of Viscount St. Albam. Such events in his life as these may
be paffed over ssightly: he was so great a man, that external
honours could add no lustre to his name. Indeed had they
been the immediate reward of those nobler services he had
done, and was still meditating to do his country, they might
deserve more particular notice, for the sake of Him who be-
stowed them.

N EITHER the weight and variety of bufiness, nor the pomps
of a Court, could divert his attention from the study of philo-
sophy. Those were his avocations and encumbrances3 this
was his beloved employment, and almost the only pleasure in
which he indulged his freer and better hours. He gave to the
public in 1620 his Novum &ganam as a second part to his

grand Instauration of the Sciences ε a work that for twelve years
