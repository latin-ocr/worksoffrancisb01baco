THE LIFE OF THE

merce: which, under her protection, grew high, and spread
itself thro the North and to both the Indies. In a word, such
was her conduct, such her good fortune, in this lssand and on
the Continent, that her allies had the strongest confidence in

her asfistance and good saith: that her enemies stood in awe of

her power, and were forced to an unwilling approbation of her⁴ ¹

prudence. The applause of such as think they' have cause to
hate, and distress us, is the fincercst‚ as it is the noblest praise.
Her oeconomy was admirable. She husbanded the public moss
ney for her people’s ease: stre laid it out, on proper occasions,

for their safety and honour. The undertakings of the govern-v

ment were never greater3 the charge was never less. This gives
the highest idea of her ministry‚ and places their characters, in
general, above imputation or reproach. ’ ’

O r Sir Nicholas Bacon, our Author's father, I have already
given some account: and {hall only add here, that he never
aspired beyond the rank he brought with him to court. His
moderation in all other respects was the same. When the Qeen
visited him at his seat in Hertforczyhire, she told him with an
air of pleasantry, that his house was too little for him. No,
replied the Lord Keeper 3 but your Majesty has made me too
great for my house.

WALSINGHAM‚ in his private charaeter, was of unblemissied
honesty. As a minister he had singular sagacity in procuring
intelligence3 which he knew to apply, with great dexterity, to
the purposes of government: devoting himself, with so genereus
a self-negleet, to the service of his country, that he gained a
reputation for contempt of riche8‚ which would have been
highly reverenced in the best times of antiquity 3 and will 'go
near, in these dayS, to be thought either folly or frenzy.

THE Lord Treasurer Burleigh, for his consummate abilities
as a statesman, was reckoned the first name of his age ε and is
still pointed out as a pattern, which we rather wish‚ than expe&
to see fully copied by his succeffors in power. As he had strong
natural partS, and was of unwearied application to bufinesS, his
experience must have been universal and unequalled3 for he was
at the head of the government almost forty years. He seems,
in particular, to have been eminently poffeffed of that intre-
pidity of head, that civil courage, so neceffary in a great mi-
nister: and without which no minister will never do any thing
