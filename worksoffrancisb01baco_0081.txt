stand it himself, answered in a voice so low and inarticulate‚
that the good Prelate knew not a word he said. This was the
famous Hermolaus Barbam .· and the Greek word, that occa·
fioned his taking so extraordinary a step is the Entclcchia of
the Peripatetics3 from whence the schoolmen raised their sub-
stantial forms, and which Leibnitz, towards the end of the
last century, attempted to revive in his Theory of mo-
tion.

THE Reformation it sels, that diffused a new light over Eu-
rope, that set men upon enquiring into errors and prepoffeffions
of every kind, served only to confirm the dominion of this
philosophy: protestants as well as papists entrenching them-
selves behind the authority of Aristotle, and defending their
several tenets by the weapons with which he furnilhed them.
This unnatural alliance of theology with the peripatetic
doctrines rendered his opinions not only venerable but sacred z
they were reckoned as the land-marks of both saith and reason,
which to pull up or remove would be daring and impious.
Inn'ovations in philosophy, it was imagined, would gradually
sap the very foundations of religion, and in the end, lead to
downright atheism. If that veil of awful obscurity, which
then covered the face of nature, should be once drawn3 the
rash curiosity of mankind would lead them to account for all
appearances in the vifible world, by second causeS, by the
powers of matter and mechanism ε and thus they might come
insensibly to forget or neglect the great original cause of all.
This kind of reasoning convinced the multitude, over-awed
the wiser few, and effectually put a stop to the progress of
useful knowledge.

SUCH, in general, were the dispositions of mankind when
Sir Francis Baton came into the world 3 whom we will not
confidet as the founder os a new sect, but as the great affertor
of human liberty3 as one who reseued reason and truth from
the ssavery in which all sects alike had, till then, held them.
As a plausible hypothesis, a shining theory, are more amusing
to the imagination‚ and a shorter way to fame, than the pa-
tient and humble method of experimendug, of pursuing na-

ture thro all her labyrinths by fact and observation 3 a phillo-
