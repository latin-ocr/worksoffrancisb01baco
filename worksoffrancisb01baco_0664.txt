OF THE INTERPRETATION

tenees, some of exactness of method, all os positive affirmatiom without dilss ’
elofing the true motives‘and'proofs of their opinionS‚ or free confessing
their ignorance or douth, except it bc now and then for a grace and* incun-
ning to win the' more credit in the rest, and not in good saith. Thaioal-
though men be' free from these errors and incumbrances in the xvillfan’ffi'ass
fection, yet it is not a thing so easy as is conceivcd, t'o convey ‘the enitebit
of one man's mind into the mind of another, without loss or mistfflfflg,
especially in notions new and diffcting from those that are receive—ds? ‘ssiat
never any knowledge was delivered in the same order it was invente'dpdto
not in the mathematicks, though it should seem otherwise, in rega'rdssffiat
’the' propositions placed last do use the propositions or grants placed fidiflfbr
their pro‘of and demonstrati0n‚ that there are forms and methodsof tradi-
tion wholly distinct and differing‚ according to their ends whereto they ‘ate
directed. That there are two ends of tradition of knowledge, theonesto
{each and instruct for use and praefice, the other to impart or intimateffiz
re-examination and progression. That the former of these ends reqlii‘sseffl a
method not the same, whereby it was invented and induccd, but stichssffis
'most compendious and ready, whereby it may be used and appliedss 'mr
the latter of the ζωός, which is where a knowledge is delivered to beffi-
'nued and spun on by a succession of labours, requircth a method whefefiff'it
may be transposed to another in the same manner as it was concavedyveo
the end it may bc discerned both where the work is weak, and where ‘it
breaketh off. That this latter method is not only unfit for the formerkiffl,
but also impoffible for all knowledge gathered' and insinuated by anticipatibriS,
because the mind working inwardly of it self, no man can give a justaecffint
how he came to that knowledge which he hath received, and that therefbte
this methodis peculiar for knowledge gathered by interpretation. Thnt't'he
discretion antiently observed, though by the precedent of many vain pel-(bns
and deceivers clisgraced, of publishing part and reserving part to a private-flie-
ceffion, and of publishing in a manner whereby it shall not be to the-capati&
nor taste of all, but {hall as it were fingle and adopt his madet, is noi-robe
laid afide, both for the avoiding of abuse in the excludcd, and the strength&-
ing of affection in the admitted. That there arc other virtues of ‘stadii-ioh,
as that there beno occasion given to error, and that it carry a vigour to ’ἐόὁε
and spread against the vanity of wits and injuries of time; all which, ifffle’y
were ever due to any knowledge delivered, or if they were never due-to· a‘h‘y

human kffiWledge hetetoforc delivered, yet are now due to the knowledge

F the impediments which have been in the affection& the princi l
whercof hath been despair ot diffidence, and the strong apprehen&

of the difficulty, obscurity and infiniteness which belongeth to the invemmn
of knowledge, and that men have not known their own strength; and-that
the supposed difficulties and vastness of the work is rather in shew and muster,
than in state or substance, where the true way is taken. That this diffidcnce
hath moved and caused some never to enter into search, and others, whgi
they have been entred, either to give over, or to secl< a more compendio s
course than can stand with the nature of true search. That of those that have
refused and prejudged enquiry, the more sober and grave sort of wits have
depended upon authors and traditions, and the more vain and eredulous rc-
