therefore he soon after sued to be reinstated in the King’s fa-
vour. To recover it, he meanly enough courted the Favourite
with an offer, which he* would not hear of when it was formerly
made to him. While in power, he had refused to give his
daughter in marriage to Sir John V illiers, not without marks of
disrespedt: he now submiffively entreated the same person to
honour him with his alliance: and employed Secretary W in-

that occafion, are written with the perplexity of a man who
fears something he is unwilling to 0wn3 which yet his prudence
passes over with a seeming unconcern, to enlarge only upon
considerations that regard those whom he would be thought to
serve. But this management proved iiieffec‘tual. It was re—
sented by the Earl of thckinghmm and checked by a rough
answer from the King. The Lady Compsam too, informed of.
