1. RANCIS BACON thought in this manner. The knowledge
F whereof the world is now poffeffed‚ especially that of nature, ex·
tendeth not to magnitude and certainty of works. The physiciari
pronounceth many diseases incurable‚ and faileth oft in the rest. The alehe-
mists wax old and die in hopes. The magicians perform nothing that is
permanent and profitable. The mechanieks take small light from natum}
philosophy, and do but spin on their own little thrids. Chance sometimes
discovereth inventions, but that worketh not in years, but ages. So he ἢν
well, that the inventions known are very unperfest, and that new are not·
like to be brought to light, but in great length of time, and that those which
are, came not to light by philosophy. .

2. H E thought also this state of knowledge was the worse, because men
strive (against themselves) to save the credit of ignorance, and to satisfythem·
selves in this poverty. For the phyfician‚ besides the cauteles of prn&ice‚‘
hath this general cautele of art, that he dischargeth the weaknelk of hisart
upon supposed impossibilities3 neither can his art be condemned, when it
self judgeth. That philosophy also, out os which the knowledge of phyfick
which now is in use is hewed‚ receivcth certain pofitions and opinion&
which (if they be well weighed) induce this persuafion, that no great works
are to be expecied from art, and the hand of man ς as in particular, tint
opinion, that the hear of the fian and fire diffi⁷r in kind 3 and that other,
that composition is the work of man, and mixture is the work of nature,
and the like; all tending rothe circumscription ofman’s power, and to arti·
ficial despair ; killing in men, not only the comfort of imagination‚ but
the industry of trial : only upon vain—glory‚ to have their art thought perfefl',
and that all is impossible, that is not already found. The alchemist discharg-
eth his art upon his own errors, either supposlng a misunderstanding of the
words of his authors, which makcth him listen after auricular tradition33 or
else a falling in the true proportionis and scruples of practice, which maketh
him renew intinitely his trials3 and finding also that he lighteth upon some
mean experiments and conclufions by the way, fcedeth upon them, and
magnifieth them to the most, and supplieth the rest in hopeS. The magi-
cian, when hc findcth something (as he conceiveth) above nature, cffccred3
thinketh‚ when a breach is once made in nature, that it is all one, to per-
form great things and small ς not sceing‚ thar they arc buz subjests of a cer-
