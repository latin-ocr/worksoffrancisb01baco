LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. xxxiii

at anew in this attack on the court of his absolute power, as
Bacon stiles it, had the matter examined before the Council 3
who condemned the Chief-Justice for what he had done, and
obliged him to make a submiffion on his kneeS. But what
compleated the distaste taken at him, was his behaviour in a
cause of the Bishop of Litclfield and Coventrj), to whom the
King had granted a vacant church in Commendam. Serjeant
Chiborne, who was council against the Bishop, in arguing the Letter142,
case had maintained several pofiti0n8‚ reckoned prejudicial and ¹⁴⁵·
derogatory to the King's supreme and imperial power, which
was affirmed to be distin& from, and of a higher nature than
his ordinary authority. lnsormed of this, Jamm, by his At-
torney Genera} Bacon, ordered the Judges to stay further pro-
ceedings in that business, till they had consulted with him.
The Judges assembled‚ and unanimoussy agreed, that they
could not obey this order ; that the letter they had received was
contrary to law3 that, by their oath and the duty of their places,
they were not to delay Justice; that they had therefore pro-
ceeded in the cause at the time fixed: and of this they certified
the King in a writing under -all their hands. Upon this remon-
strance, he writ them an angry letter, and peremptorily com-
manded them to stay all proceedings‚ till his return to London.
They were then summoned· before the Council, and sharply
reprimanded for suffering the popular lawyers to question his
prerogative‚ which was represented as sacred and transcendent,
not to be handled or mentioned in vulgar argument. At last
raising his voice, to frighten them into submiffion, he put this
question to them severally: “ if, at any time, in a case depend-
“ ing before the Judges‚ he conceived it to concern him either
“ in profit or power, and thereupon required to consult with
1‘ them, and that they should stay proceedings in the mean
“ time3 whether they ought not to stay them accordingly?''
They all, the Chief Justice only excepted, acknowledged it
their duty to do so, His answer deserves to be for ever remem- ΜΝ· ‘'0¹-

bred: “ That when such a case happened, he would do that izi}- mm

“ which should be. fit for a Judge to do.’⁷
YET this great Lawyer‚ who had the honest courage to re-
fist the King to his face, wanted that independance of mind
which alone enables a man to bear solitude, and an acquain-
tance with himself. His disgrace, which refletstcd more honour
