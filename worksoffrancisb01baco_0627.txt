THE PENAL LAws,

is an intermixture of mei-ey and justice, that will bring you fear and obedi-
ence: for too much rigor makes people desperate. And therefore to leave
this, which was the only blemish of King Henry VlI's reign, and the unfor-
tunate service of Emstsbn and Dudlesy, whom the people's curseS, rather
than any law, brought to overthroxv3 the other work, is a work not only
of profit to your Majcsty, but of piety towards your people. For if it be
true in any proportion, that within these five years of your Maiesty's happy
reign, there hath not five hundred pounds benefit come to your Majesty by
pcnal laws (the fines of the Star-chamber, which are of a higher kind, only
except) and yet nevertheless there hath been a charge of at least fifty thousand
pounds which hath been layed upon your people, it were more than time it
¹received a remedy.

THIS remedy harh been fought by diverse statutes, as principally by a
stattlte in 18. and another of 31. of the late Queen of happy memory. But
I am of opinion that the appointing of an officer proper for that purpose,
,will do more good than twenty statutes, and will do that good effectually,
'which these statutes aim at intentionall y.

AND thisI do allow of the better, because it is none of those new su-
perintendencics, which I see many times offered upon pretence of reforma-
tion, as if Judges did not their duty, or ancient and sworn Officers did not
their duty and the like: but it is only to set a Custos or watchman, neither
over Judges nor clerks, but only over a kind of people that cannot be suffici-
ently watched or overlooked, and that is the common promoters or infor-
mers; the very awe and noise whereof will do much good, and the praefice
much more.

1 will therefore set down first what is the abuse or inconvenicnce‚ and then
what is the remedy which may be expected from the industry of this officer.
And 1 will divide it into two parts, the one, for that they may concern the
ease of your people (for with that 1 will crave leave to begin, as knowing it
to be prineipal in your Majesty's intention) and the other for that, that may
concern your Majesty's benefit.

⁴ Concerning the ease of his Majesty's subje&S‚ polled and vexed
by common informers.

The almfis or inconveniencies.

Ι. AN informer exhibits an infor-
mation‚ and in that one information‚
he will put an hundred several sub-
jests of this information. Every one
{hall take out copies, and every one
{hall put in his several answer. This
will eost perhaps a hundred marks:
that done, no further procceding.
But the Clerks have their sees, and
the informer hath his dividend for
*bringing the water to the mill.

Ιτ is to be noted, that this vexa-
tionis not met with by any statute.

The remedies by the industry of the
officer.

1. The offieer by his diligence find-
ing this case, is to inform the court
thereof, who thereupon may grant
good costs against the informer, to
every of the subjeas vexed: and with-
al not suffer the lame informer to re-
vive his information against any of
thenis and lastly fine him, as for a
misdemeanor and abuse of justice, and
by that time a few of such examples
be made, they will be soon wear-y of
that practice.
