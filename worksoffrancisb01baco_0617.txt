and weak estates are more exposed z which so happy fruit of the union of

·kiiigd0ms is chiefly to be understood, when such coniunctiori or augmenta-
tion is not wrought by conquest and violence, or by paCt and subiniffiom

but by the law of nature and hereditary descent. For in conquest it is com-

monly seen, although the bulk and quantity ot* territory be increase-d, vet

the strength of kingdoms is diminished‚ as well by the wassing of the for'ces

of both parts in the confliCt, as by the evil coherenee ofthc nation conquer-

ing and conquered‚ the one being apt to be insomne and the other discon-

tents and so both full of jealoufies and discord. And where countries arc an-
nexed only by a& of estates and submffliom, such stibmiffions are commonly

grounded upon fear, which is no good author of cominuance, besides the
‘'quarrels and revolts which do ensue upon conditional and articulate subjee-
tiotts τ’ But when the lines of two kingdoms do meet in the person of one
Mon-arch, as in a true point or perse& angles and that from marriage (which
'is the first conjunctim] in human society) there ihall proceed one inheritor in
blood to several kingdomS, whereby they are actually united and incorporate

*under one head3 it is the work of God and nature, whereunto the works of
force and policy cannot attain3 and it is that which harh not in it sclt' any
rmanner of seeds of discord or disunion, other than such as en'vy and malig-
nity shall sow, and which gronndeth an rinion, not only indiffoluble‚ but

also most comfottable and happy amongst the people. We therefore in all

humbleness acknowledge‚ that it is the great and blessed work of Almighty
God, that these two ancient and mighty realms of Englana' and scotland,

,which by nature have no true but aniinaginaty separation, being both {ituate
and comprehended in one most famous and renowned issand of Great Bri-
tany, compaffed by the ocean without any mountains‚ seas, or other boun-
daries of nature, to make any partit‘ion‚ wall or trench between them, and
being also exempted from the first curse of disunion, which was the confu—
{ion of tongues, and being people of a like constitution of mind and body, espe-
cially in watlike prowess and disposition ε and yet nevertheless have in so many
ages been disjoined under several Kings and Governours‚ are now at the last
by right inherent in the commixture of our blood, united in our person
and genet-arion, wherein it hath pleased God to anoint us with the oil of

gladness and gratulation above our progenitorS, Kings of either nation.

Neither can we sufficiently contemplate and behold the passages, degrecs and

infinuastons, whereby it hath pleased the eternal God (to whom all his

works are from the beginning known and present) to open and prepare a

way to this excellent work; having first ordained that both nations should be

knit in one true and reformed religion, which is the perfeetest band of all u-

nity and union3 and secondly, that there thould precede so long a peace con-

tinued between the nations for so many years last past, whereby all sccds

and sparks of ancient discord have been laid asseep‚ and grown to an obli-

teration and oblivion3 and lastly‚ that our selves in the true measure of our

affeffions, should have so just cause to imbrace both nations with equal and

indifferent love and inclination‚ inasmuch as our birth and the passing of

the first part of our age hath been in the one nation, and our principal seat

and maulim, and the paffing of the latter part of our days is like to be in the

other. Which our cqual and upright holding of the ballance between both

nations, being the highest point of all others in our distributive justice, we

give the world to know, that we aree constantly resolved to preserve invio-
