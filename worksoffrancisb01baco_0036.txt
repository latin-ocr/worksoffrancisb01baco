or public, to attone for them: an open scoffer at the obligations¹ Ῑι

of morality‚ insolent, rapaciou8‚ sanguinary3 hated by, and*

hating, all good men. The honestet part of the nobility'oft'en‘

remonstrated against the credit and pernicious influence of this‘
Minion: James acknowledged the justice of their remon-strances23' v
banished him several times from court ; and several times res

ceived him into new favour. He was at length ssiot by apri-3

vate hand in revenge for the death of the Earl of Mortem, to

which he had basely contributed.

JAMES hated the church of Scotla72d3 and confirmed iteam-i

thoi-ity. He declared the attempt of those Lords, who had

¹rescued him out of the hands of Arrun and meox, to be just*
and serviccable: he afterwards banished them, and would have ¹*

confiscated their estates, on that very account. When they
had made themselves masters of his person a second time, he
pronounced them all traitor83 and pardoned them, ’

ELIZABETH, who knew his genius perfeetly‚ sent Mr. Wotion
on an embaffy to him in 1 58 5. Her intention was to divert ·

him from a marriage with the Princess of Denmark, and to
give his counsels what other turn her interests might require.
The ambaffador, a man of address and intrigue, had, by long

habitude, learnt to personate all characters, and to assume,-

with an ease that seemed altogether unaffec'ted, whatever shape
might serve most effectually the purposes of his superiors. , At

the age of twenty-one he had been employed to found the in-.-

tentions of the court of France: and had well nigh duped
the famous Constable de Montmorenqy, a minister grown grey
in the observation of human falsehood and artifice. To his
natural talent he had now added the experience of thirty years
more. By accompanying King James in, his sports; by falling
in franl ly, and as it were naturally, with all his paffions; by
making a jest of business3 by entertaining him pleasantly with
an account of foreign fashions and follies; this man gained an
absolute ascendant not only over his understanding, but over

his humour. His most faithful subjects, who had served him?

longest and best, who had even warned him against the subtle-
ties of this stranger, he received with approbation or dissike‚

v just as W otton inspired him. He was even brought by him to

be serioussy persuaded that the King of Demnark was descend-

ed from a race of merchants; and that au alliance with his-

daughter
