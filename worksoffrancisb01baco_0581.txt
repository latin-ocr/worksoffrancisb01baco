 

A WAR WITH SPAIN.

King's blood, or our own blood, or Christ’s blood be dcar unto us, the
quari-el is just, and to be embraced.

Fon the point of sufficient forces, the ballancing of the forces of these
kingdoms and their allies, with Spain and their alnes, you know to be a
matter of great and weighty confiderati0n3 but yet to wcigh them in a
common under-standing, for your part, you are of opinion that Spain is
no such giant3 or if he be a giant, it will be but like Goliah and David,
for-God will be on our fide.

'Bur to leave these spiritual confiderations‚ you do not see in true dis-
course ‘of peace and war, that we ought ro doubt to be ovet-matehed. To
this' opinion you are led by two things which lead all mcn3 by experienee,
and‘by reason.

'‘FoR experience‚ you do not find that for this age (take it for 100 years)
thore was ever any encounter between Spanish und Englg'fh of importance,
either by sea or land, but the English came off with the honour5 witness the
ssammas-qug the retreat of (inunt, the battle of Newport² and some
others: but there have been some actions both by sea andland, so memo-
rable as scarce suffer the less to be spoken of. By sea, that of eighty-eight,
when the Spaniards putting themselves most upon their stirrups, sent forth
that invincible Armada which lhould have swallowed up England qnick3
the success whereof was, that although that fleet swam like mountains upon
our scas, yet they did not so much as take a cock-boat of ours at sea, nor
fite a cottage at land, but came through our channel, and were driven, as
Sir* Walter Ralezgh ίίῑγε, by squibs (fite-boats he means) from Calais,
and were soundly beaten by our ships in fight, and many of them sunk,
and finally dul-st not return the way they came, but made a scattcrcd per-
ambulation‚ full of shipwrecks, by the Irish and Scottfh seas to get home
again3 just according to the curse of the scripture, that thcfy came out

ainst us one wqy, and fied before ussi‘ven ways. By land, who can
ξιξ-ἔα the two voyages made upon the continent itself of Spain, that of
Lisbon‚ and that of Cales, when in the former we knock'd at the gates of

the greatest city either of Spain or ‘Portugak and came off without sccing .

an enemy to look upon usin the face? And though we failed in our foun-
dation, (for that Antonio whom we thought to replace in his kingdom found
no party at all) yet it was a truc trial of the gentlcncss of Spain, which suf-
fered us to go and come without any dispute. · And for the latter, of Cales,
it ended in vistory3 wc ravilhed a principal city of wealth and strength
in the high eonntries, sacked it, tired the Indian fleet that was in the port,
and came home in triumplu and yet to this day were never put in suit fot
it, nor demanded reason for our doingS. Yon ought not to forgct the battle
ofKinsale in Ireland, what time the Spanish forces were joined with the
Irqh (good soldiers as themselves or better) and exceeded us far in number,
and yet they were soon defeated, and their general D'Avila taken prisoner,
and that war by that battle quenched and ended.

AND it is worthy to be noted how much out power in those days was
inferiour to our present state. Then, a lady old, and owner only of Eng-
land, intangled with the revolt of Irdand, and hcr confederates of Hollaml
much makes, and in no conjunctum. Now, afamous king, and strengrhcned
with a Prince¹ of singular c.*<pet'.iatioti² and in the prime of his years, owner
of the entire ille of Britain, enjoying Ireland populate and quiet, and in-
finitely more lupportcd by consedet-ates of the Low Comitries, Dazmark,
