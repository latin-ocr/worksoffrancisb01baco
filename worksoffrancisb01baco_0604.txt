OF THE STATE OF EUROPE.

Tu us is the· King of France sollicited against those of the religion -i'ae,
France3 the Emperor against those in his dominions; divifions set in Germaaey ς-
the Low Country‘miserably opprcss'cd3 and daily attempts against her Majesty,
both by force and practice: hereto serve the seminar-ies, where none are now*
admitted, but take the oath against her Majesty.

T HE sest of rheJesuits are special instruments to alienate the people from
her Maiesty, sow faffion, and to-absolvc them of the oathof obedienee, ands
prepare the way torebellion and revolt.

BEstnEs, for confirmation of their own* religion they have used som*
reformation of the clergy, and brought in catechising.

To goforth with the Princes of Italy next in sttuation :

mke offus- THE Great Duke of Tuft'argy, Francisco de Medici, son to Cosmo, and⁴

mny.

the third duke of that family and province3 of the age of forty years, of dis..
position severe and sad, rather than manly and graves no princely port ος
behaviour more than a great justicer, inclined to peace‚· aud gather-ing money.
All Tushany is subject nnto him, wherein were divers emimonwealths';
whercof the chief were Florem, Siena and' Pzfiz, ‘Prata and Pistam, (ἐν-
ing Lucca and certain forts on the sea-coast, hcld' by the King of Spain.

HE retaineth-in his service few, and they· strangers, to whom he sgivethq
pensions. In all his eitadels he harh garrison of Spaniards, except at Siena;
in house-keeping spendcth little, being as it were in penfi0n, agreeing for
st) much the year with a citizen of Florence for his diet: he has a small guard
of Swiffers, and when he rideth abroad a guard of forty light horsemen.‚
The militia of his country amounteth to forty thousand soldiers, to the which
he granteth leave to wear their weapons on the holy days, and other immuni-‚
ries. Befides, he entertaineth· certain men of arms, to the which he giveth
seven crowns the montht He also maintaineth seven galim, the which serve
under his knights, eressed by his father in Pifiz, of the order· of St. Stephano ς
of these gallim, three go every year in chase. >

H 1 s common exercise is in distillations, and in trying of conclusions, the
which he doth exereise in a house called Caffino in Florence, where he spend-‚
eth the most part of the day, giving ear in the mean season to matters of af-
fairs, and conferring with his chief Officers. His revcnues are esteemcd to
amount to a million and a half of crowns, of the which spending half a mil-j
lion, he layeth up yearly one million. But certainly he is the richest Prince'
in all Europe of coin. The form of his government is absolute, depending,
only of his will and pleasure, though retaining in many things the ancient
offices alid shew. But those magistrates resolve nothing without his express>
directions and pleasure. Privy council he useth none, but reposeth most
iiis trust on found secretarics, and conferreth chiefly wimbis wife, as his fa:
ther did with one of his sterctariCS. For matter of examinationS, one corbolo
harh the especial trust5 he eloth favour the people more than the nobility‚
because they do bear an old grudgc to the gendemen, and the people are the
more in number, without whom the nobility cando nothing. One thing

receive ancl hear all their petitions himself. And in his absence from Florence,
those that have suit cio-resort to the office, and there exliibit their bill eudor-
sed53 whercof within three days absolute answer is returned them, unless. the
matter be of great importance‚ then have they dircssion how to proceed.
He is a great justicer, and for the case of the people; and to have the better
eye over justice, hath built hard by his palaee a fair row- of houses for all
offices together in oue place. T wo
