⁴⁴oF QUEEN -ΕιῐΖΑΕΕΤΗ, 23

liberty upon whom he tyrannizeth not: let them all know, it is by the
mercy of this renowned Queen, that standeth between them and their
misfortunes. These be some of the beams of noble and radiant magnani-
mity, in contempt of peril which so manifestly, in contempt of profit -which
so many admire, and in merit of the world -which so many include iu
themielves3 set forth in my {implicity of speech with much loss of lnstre,
but with neat approach of truth; as the sun is seen in the water,

: 5wa to pass to the excellencies of her person3 the view of them wholly A persam,
and notaeverally, do make so sweet a wonder, as Ι fear to divide them.
Again, nobility extrastcd out of the royal and vietor-imis line of the Kings of
England3 yea, both roscs, white and red, do as well ssourilh in her nobility
as in 1101· beauty‚ as health, such as was like, 1110 should have that was brought
⁴forth *by two of the most goodly princes of the world, in the strength of their
ynam, in the heat of their love; that hath been injured neither with an over-
iiberal nor over-curious diet, that hath not been sustained by an umbratile
-4ife still under the roos, but strengthened by the use of the pure and open air,-
that still retaineth flower and vigour of youth. For the beauty and many
graces of her presence, what colours are fine enough for such a portraiture?

vleit nostlight poet be used for such a description, but the chastest and 1110
rovae :

Of her gait3 Et vera inceffu patuit Dea.
’ of her voice3 Nec vox‘ hominemsonat.
Ι Of her eye3 Et laetos oculis afflavit honores.
Of her colour3 Indum sanguineos veluti violaverat ostro
” Siquis ebur. ἱ
Of her neck3 E t rqsba cervice refuffin
Of her brcast3 Vestestnns colleHa fluentes.
Of her hair ,- Ambrostaeque comae divinum vertice odorem
Spiravere.

11·- this be presumption‚ let him bear the blame that owcth the verses. What
shall .1 [peak of her rare qualities of compliinent5 which as they be excellent
in the things themselch, so they have always besides somewhat of a Qieen:
and as Qieens use {hadows and veiis with their rich apparc13 methink in all
her qualities there is somewhat that flieth from ostentation, and yet inviteth
the mind to contemplate her more ?

. WnAr should l speak of her excellent gift of speech, being a character ofAszrs-me,
'the greatness of her conceit‚ the height of her degree, and the swectness of
’.1101- nature? W‘hat life, what edgc is there in those words and glanccs where-
with at pleasure lhe can give a man long to thinl<5 be it that she mean to
da-unt him, to encourage him, or to amaze him! How admirable is her
difeourse, whether it be in learning, state, or love! what variety of know-
ledge3 what rareness of conccit3 what choice of wordss what grace of
utterance! Doth it not appear, that though her wit be as the adamant ot'
excellencies, which drawcth out of any book ancient or new, out of any
writing or speech, the best: yet she refineth it, 1110 enrichcth it far above the
:value wherein it is received? And is her speech only that language which the
child learneth with pleasure, and not those which the studious learn with
industry? Hath 1110 1101 attained, beside her rare eloquence in her own
languagc‚ infinitely polishcd since her happy times, changes of her languagcs

both learned and modern „³ so that she is able 10 negotiatcwith digest? {irn-
