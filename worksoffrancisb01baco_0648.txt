OF THE INTERPRETAiIO

this difference, that the ancient regions os knowledg „xe will seem :is⁴ barba,

THE di‹r ginity of this end (of cndoxvment of man's life xx ith new com-

nioditics) appearcth b) the estimation that antiquity made of such as guifftf ·
thereunt03 for whereas founders of sturm, laxv- -giv ers, extit-pers of t '‘ran‘ff‘
fathers of the people, were honoured but with the titles of worthics oide'fins
gods, inventors w cre' ev er consecrated amongst the Gods themselves And
if the ordinary ambitions of men lead them to secl< the amplification o'f thje‘ii'
own power in their countries, and a better ambition than that harh move-d
rnen to seck the amplification of the power of their own countries aniohgsto-
ther nations; better again and more worthy must that aspiring be, which.
seekcth the amplification of the poxx er and kingdom of mankind ovet th‘c':
xvorzld the rather, because the other two prosecutions arc cv er culpab'le of
much perturbation and injustice; but this as a work trnly divine, xviisth
cometh m aura leni, without noiic or observation.

THE aeccis also to this work harh been by that port or passage, which tn&
dixine Majesty (who is unchangeable in his xv ays) doth infallibly continue
and obici-·ve ‚ that is, the felicity xv herewith he hath bleffed an humilify b'f
mind, luch as rather laboureth to spell, and so by degrees to read in the v‘o-
lurnes of his creatures, than to lollicit and ur1D e, and asir xv ere toinx'rocate a
man' s own spirit to divine, and give oracles unto him. For asin theicpgi
of divine truth, the pride of man harh ever inclined to leave the ora siff
God s word, and ro vanish in the mixture of their own inv entions3f01n die
sclf- same manner in inquisition of nature, they have cvcr left the oracles' or*
God’s woi·l<s‚ and adored the deceivi'ng and deformed imagery, which the
'unequal miri ouis of their own ininds hav e represented unto them. Nay, itis
a point fit and neeessary in the front, and beginning of this wor‚k without
hesitation or reseix atlon to be professed, that it is no less, true in this Ῐΐὶιῖὶῒὲἑῄ
kin c§dom of knoxvledg c, than in God's kingdom of heaven that nonius:

T appeareth then what is now in proposition, not by general circumis>
Ι cution, but by particular note, no former philosophy varied in terms or
metliod; no new placet or speculation upon particulais already known;
no 1¹⁴·chi1ing to action, by any manual ofprae‘tice3 but the rev caling and cli-s
eovering of new inv entions and operations. This to be done without the
ci·r·ois and conjectures os art, or the length or difficulties of expericnce5 the
nature and kinds of xx hich inventions have been described as they could hc
dileoxcrel; ior v our eye cannot pals one kenning without further sailiiig:
only xx e hire stood upon the best advantagcs of the notioris received, as upon “
a mount, to lhexv the knowledg ocs adjacent and confinin„ σ. If therefore the
true end of knowledge, not propounded‚ harh bred large error, the best and
perfeCiest condition of the inme end, not perceived, will cause some decli·
nation. Forxx·licn the butt is set up, men need not πονε, but except the
white be placed, men munot level. This perfeetion we mean, notin the
