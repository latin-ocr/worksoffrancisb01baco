ballance, xx 111011 consisted of 311 accusation and a dcfence, and such ethes}
seditious plu-arcy , w hereupon her Majesty seeing her selfinte'rcsted m honohr,
which she 113011 ever [ought to prelerve as her eyc, clear and without nium
was inforced to relolve of 3 judieial hearing of the caules which was aeeotdqsx
ingly appointed in the end of Hilary term. At the which time waning ,
being given to my Lord to prepare himself, he falling 35 10 scemed in a--deep J
consideration of his estate, made unto her Maiesty by letter 311 1111111111ιῖ πρά j
effectual submiffion, beseeching her that that bitter cup of justice mighbpnss
from him, (for those were his words 3) which wrought such 311 131ρο0111011έὶει
her Majesty's mind, that it not only rex-ived in her her former resolution to
forbear any publiek hearing, but it fctched this virtue out of 111οτογ by the
only touch, 35 few days after my Lord was removed to further liberty in his
own 1101110, her Majesty hoping that these bruirs and malicious imputatione»
would of themselves wax old 31101 iani 111ς but finding it otherwise in proof,
upon taste taken by some intermission of time, and cipccially beholding the
hum our of the time in 3 letter presumed to be written to her Maiesty 1101· self
by 31301), 00 whom though nearest 111 blood to my Lord, it athaiqed
little to intermeddle 111 matters of this nature, otherwise than m courffi of
humility to have sollicited her grace and mercy3 in which letter, in acerram
violent and mineral lpirit of bitternelS, remonstrance and representation 15 “
1113010 to her Maiesty3 as if my Lord suff'cred under passion and fae'tion, and
not under justice mixed with mcrcy: xx 111011 letter, though written 001101·
sacred Maiesty‚ and therefore unfit 00 pass 111 vulgar hands, yet was firstdivulg-.
001 by cop1es every where (that being as it scemeth the newest and-fincst soem:
of libelling) 31101 since committed to the press, her Majcsty in her wisdom
sceing manifestly these rumours thus nourilhed had got too great a head robe
repress'ed without some hearing of the cause, and callitig my Lord to answcn,
And yet 011 0110 other side being still informcd touehing my Lord bimari& ok}
his continuance of penitenee and submission, did m conclusion, resolve. to use·
justice, but with the cdge 31101 point taken off and rebatcd3 for whereaapoq:
thing leav eth that teint upon honour (which in a person of my Lord's con-l
dition 15 hardliest repaired) 111 question of justice, 35 to be called to the ordinary*
and open place of offenders and criminals, her Maiesty had ordered that th·
hearing should be intra domesticosparietes, and not luceforensl. And where·
35 again 111 the Star- Chamber‚ there be certain formalities (not fit 111 regardo&
example to be dilpensed with) which would strike deeper both into my Lenda,
