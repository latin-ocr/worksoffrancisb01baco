''IMPOSITIONS oN MERCHA‘NDISES.

Imight make mention of the jurisdistion of some coum, of diseretion
⁴ ”wherein the judges did not deeIIne to give opinion. Therefore had this been
againstlaxxg there would not have been altum stlentium in the Kiug's courts.

1 Of the contrary judgments I will not yet speak; thus much now, that there

2, is no judgment‚ no nor plea against it. Though I said no more, it were

J enough, in my opinion, to induce you to a non liquet, to leave it a doubt.

’ THE second confideration is the force and continuanee of payments made
by grants of mercham, both strangers and Englyh, without consent of par—
liament. Hei-ein I lay this ground, that such grants considered in them-

'xselves are void in law: for mercham, either strangers or lhbieels, they are

ε no body corporate, but fingular and dispersed persons3 they cannot bind

.;succeffion‚ neither can the major part bind the residue: how then lhould

,²{s3‘pheir grants have force ? No otherwise but thus; that the King's power of

{Empofing was only the legal virtue and strength of those grant53 and that

filie consent of a merchant is but a concurrence, the King is princtpale agens,

gand they are but as the patient, aud so it becomes a binding a& out οἷ’ the

{ffiKing’s power.

’ ¹ Now if any man doubt that such grants of merchauts should not be of
force, Iwill alledge but two memorable records, the one for the merchauts

, strangers‚ the 'other for the merchants English. That for the strangersis up-

,οη the grant of chart. mercator. of three peuce in valuc ultra antiquas.¹ m, .

ι ¹ stamas3 which grant is in use and practice at this day. For it is wellffmmft. νῖιῖνη

‚ix nown to the merchants, that that which they call stranger's custom, aiid“²'⁰'‘j‘¹·

fferreneoussy double custom, is but three pence in the pound more than Eng-

''Yistn Now look into the statutes of subfidy of tonnage and pouudagc⁷ :uid
you ssaall find (a few merchandise only excepted) the pouudage equ-al upon

· *alienand subjeet3 so that this difference or exeess of three peuce hath no

'other ground than that grant. It falleth to be the same in quantity3 there
is no statute for it, and therefore it ean have no strength but from the mer-
chant’s graut33 and the merehant’s grants can have no strength but from
'the King’s power to impose.

FoR the merchants English, take the notable record iu 17 E. ζ. where ¹7 Ed. 3»,
the commons complaincd of the forty strillings upon the sack of wool as a
· male-toll set by the ass'ent of the merchants without consent of parliament3
pay, they dispute and say it were hard that the merchants consent should be
in damage of the commons. XVhat sayeth the Kiug to thern? doth he grant
it or give way to it? Nos but replies upon them and sayeth, it cannot be
rightly construed to bein prejudice of commons, the rather because provi-
Fon was made, that the merchants should not work upon them, by colour

, ofthatpaymcnt to increase their price3 in that there was a price certain set

.''upon the wools, and there was an end of that matter: which plainly affirm-
*eth the force ot'the merchants grants. So then the force ot* the grauts of
‘merchants both E⁷lglffl⁷ and strangers appeareffl, and their grauts being not
corporate, are but mun (zcg'jeffives without the Kiug's power to impose.

THE third consideration is of the first and most ancient coinuiencemeut of
bustorum whercin 1 am [otnewhat to seck3 for ab the poet saith Ingreditur-
questam, όν capnt mser nubila condit, the beginning of it is obscure: but
1 rather conceive that it is by common law than by grant in parliameut. For
first, Mr. Drer's opinion was) that the ancient custoni for exportatiou was
by the common laws3 and goeth further, that that ancient custoui was the
‘custom upon xvools, woolfells and leather : he was dcccitcd in the particular,
