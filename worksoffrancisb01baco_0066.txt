THE LIFE O'FVTHE'· ἶ

AFTER a short confinement in the Tower, the King resto-⁴
red him to his liberty, and sorgave the fine in which the Par-‹-
liament had amerced him. . As this fine was very considerable,
he managed so as to have it assigned over to some os his {fienda
under the notion of being his, creditors: And we find W it‘liamsg
his succefforin the seals, complaining heavily of this stratagem3 ω
if he thereby intended to defraud those persons to whom he was ne-³

· ally in debt, who were many and in danger of being ruinedb35

his fall. ButI am inclined to hope, that he made use of this ard-0,
fiee with a more innocent view 3 namely, to procu re him selfa-ssmrt‘
respite srom their importunitie8‚ till he could settle his private
affairs, extremely perplexed by former ill management, and»
now by the loss of his employments rendered desperate. Tha!
I may not be obliged to mention any more an affair, alike uri-,⁶
grateful to the reader and writer, I will observe here, that
about three years aster this, he petitioned King Jamesffsor a)
total remiflion of his censure : ‘⁶ to the end that this blot of
“ ignominy might be removed from him, and from his memori&
‘⁶ with posterity.” What lay in a King’s power, James readily›
granted, a full and entire pardon of his whole sentenfee, ⁴³⁶.-
Posterity likewise, to which he appealed, has seemed unwilling⁴
to remember that he ever offended: and those ,who record his
failings, like those who have made observations on the spots ἐξῇ,
the sun, neither pretendto diminish his real brightnessin him-1
self, nor deny his universal influence on the world of learning.-
Thus he withdrew from the glare of a public station into > the
{hade of retirement and studious leisure 3 often lamenting, that

0 vambition and false glory had so long diverted him from the,

noblest as well as the most useful employments of a reasonable
being: mortified, no doubt, into these sentiments by a severe
conviction, in his own person, of the instability and emptiness-
of all human grandeur.

HITHERTO, we havefollowed him thro the bustle and ob·
liquity of business. We shall find him hencesorth in a more
pleasing, tho a less conspiciiouS‚ situation 3 freed from the ser-2
vitude of a court3 from an intolerable attendance there, on.
the vices *and follies of men every way his inferiors, (for in this
reign no one could rise to power on more honourable terms z) ,
in acondition now to pursue the native bent of his genius3 to

live

' ‘³ Accordingly he was summoned to the first Parliament of Kiug Clam-[25.
