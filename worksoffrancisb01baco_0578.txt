OF THE TRUE G‘REATNESS

we see by infinite examples‚ and none more memorable than that of Con-

stantinus the last emperor of the Greeks, and the citizens of Constantinople,⁴
11111 rubjects do often chuse rather to be frugal dispenlcrs for their enemies,

than liberal lenders to their prince. Again, whereloever the wealth of the
subject rs engross'ed mto few hands, it 15 not poffible 1t should be so respondent
and yielding to payments and contributions for the publick, both because

the true estimation or affeffrnent of great wealth is more obscure and une,

certain3 and because the burden seemeth lighter when the charae lieth-u

many hands3 and further, because the same greatness of wealth is for the most·

part not collected and obtained without sucking it from many, according te»

the received similitude of the spleen, which never swelleth but when the 16111,

of the body pineth and abateth. And lastly, it cannot be that any 1111631611
should leave a second overplus for the publick that doth not first leave an
overplus to the private stock of him that gathers 11· , and therefore nothing 15
111016 66113111, than that those states are least able to aid -11161 defray great charae
for wars, or other publick disbursements‚ whose wealth resteth chiefly m the

hands of the nobility 31161 gentlemen. For what by reason of their magni--

fieence and waste in expence, and what by reason of their defu-e to advance
and make great their own families, and again upon the coincidence of the
former reason, because they are always the fewest; small is the help, as to
payments or charge, that ean be levied or expecIed from them towards the oc-
63110115 of a state. Contrary it is of such states whose wealth resteth in the
hands of merchants, burghers, tradesmen, frecholders, farmers in the country,
and the like, whereof we have a most evident and present example before our.

eyes, in our neighbours of the Low Countries‚ who could never have endured ’

and continued so inestimable and insupportable charge, either by their natural
frugality, or by their mechanical industry‚ were it not also that there was a
coneurrence in them of this last reason, which is, that their wealth was dispersed
in many hands, and not ingross'ed into few, and those hands were not much
of the nobility, but most and generally of inferior conditions.

To make application of this part concerning treasure to your Maiesty's
kingdoms:

F 111 ST, 1 suppose Ι 63111101 611, that as to the endowmcut of your crown,
there is not any crown of Europe, that hath so great a proportion of demesne
and land revenue. Again, he that 111311 look into your prerogative thau
find it to have as many streams to feecl your treasury, as the prerogat‘we of
any of the said Kings, and yet without oppresfion or taxing of your pcople.
For they be things unknown in many other states, that all rich mines should
be yours, though in the soil of your [11ϋί66155 that all wardlhips should be
yours, where a tenure in chief is, of lands held of your [1111166151 that all
confiscations and elcheats of treason should be yours, thou<C 11 1116 tenure be
of the 1111116615 that all 36110115 popular, and the fines and calualities there-
upon may be informed in your name, and should be due unto you, and a
moiety at the least where the subject himself informs. And further, he that
111311 look 1nto your revenucs at the ports of the sea, your revenues in courts
of justice, and for the stirriug of your 16315,1116 1616111165 11ρο11 your clergy,
and the rest, will conclude, that the law of England studied how to make a
rich crown, and yet without 161165 upon your [11111661. For merchandizing,
it is true, 11. was 61 er by the kings of this realm despised, as a thing ignoble
