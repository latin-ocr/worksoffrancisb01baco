whom the King of Spam would fain have persuaded that it was a devouter

whercby his delire of invading of England was ssackened and put off some years,
and by that means was put in execution at a time for some serpens much
more to his disadvantage. And the same invasion, like and as if it had been
attempted before, it had the time much more proper and favourablc5 so
likewise, had it in true discourse a better season afterwards: for, if it had
been dissolved till time 11131 1116 Leagzte had been better confirmed in France3
which no doubt would have been, if the Duke of Guifi’, who was the only
man of worth 011 11131 fide, had lived; and the French King durst never have
laid hand upon him, had he not been animated by the English viftory against
the Spaniards precedent. And 111611, if some maritime town had been
gotten into the hands of the League, 11 11αά been a great surety and strength

should. I speak of the opportune death of her enemies, and the wicked in-

of Lenox‚ who was used as 311 instrument to divorcc Scotland from the
amity of England, died in no ill season: a man withdrawn indeed at that

am persuaded they will die. What should 1 speak of the fortunes of her
