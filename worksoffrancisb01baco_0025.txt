justice on her part than is usually observed by princes when
they would do ill· offices to their neighbo'urs. The sovereigns
bf those countries, when they agreed in nothing else, were
ever combined in a common enmity to her: at a time too when
1116 had nothing to' oppose against their pretenfions, their con-
spiracies, their open attacks, but her own cou rage and the native
strength of England alone. And yet, by helping forward the
reformation in Scotland3 by supporting the protestants in France3
by the wise and well-managed supplies sne sent to the Dutch,
who were struggling hard for their lives and liberties with an
unrelenting tyrant: by this series of conduct, steadily pursued‚
1116 triumphed over all oppofition, and rendered her self the
arbitress of Eur-ope. For it may be affirmed, that her admi-

· nistration made a greater impression on all the states round her,

than it received itself from any: an undoubted psoof of its firm—
1'1ess and active vigor.

WHEN she came to the crown, she found the nation four
millidns in debt: a sum then almost incredible! and yet her
oeconomy alone enabled her to discharge it. The Coin, which
had been much embased by Heury the Eighth‚ and by Mary
wholly neglected, she quickly restored to its just standard3 and
therewith the public saith and credit. Her magazines she care-
fully replenished with arms, ammunition‚ warlike stores of
every kind: and the youth all over England were ordered to
be duly trained in military exercises. Her navy was fallen to
decay, and almost abandoned. This {he set her self to repair
with an attention, which the great bulwark of this kingdom
will ever deserve from a Prince, who understands in what his
own strength and that of his dominions naturally confist. Her
fleet was at last a match for the mighty Armada of Spain: that
Armada, Which was boasted to be invincible, and was in truth
a desperate effort of the whole power and resentment of her
bitterest enemy. Her victory over him, as entire as it was glo-
rious, gave security and renown to this Issand: and, whatever
the partiality of foreign writers may have infinuated to the
contrary, she owed it to her own heroical conduct, and the un-
exampled bravery of her subjeffits.

Sar-2 was the first of our Princes who pursued, in any con—

siderable degree, the only sure method of making Englaml

great and powerfu13 by encouraging and extending our com-
