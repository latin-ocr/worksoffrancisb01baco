OF THE TRUE GREAT‘NESS

their adr enerues, nor no other title but their swords, nor no other p} ers ι) vg
their poverty. For it was not w ith most of there people as it is in countrics
reduced to a regular civility‚ that no man almost marrieth except he see he
1111 e means to liv·e ‚ but population went on, how soev er sustentation follow ed,

lurcharged, with people, they divided their inhabitants into three p rts, and.
oue third as the lot fell, was [ent abroad and left to their adr entQures
Ncither' 15 the reason much unlilce ' thou gh the effect harh not follow ed ιιι re-
gard of a special diverfiou) in the narion nos the Swg'ffes inhabiting a country,
which ιιι rcgard of the mountainous situation, and the popular estate, ,doth
generate r: ster than it can snstain. ln which.5 peopIe, it well appeared what
an authority iron harh over gold at the battle of Gransbn, at w hat time ou'e
of the prineipal jewels of Burgundy w as sold for twelxe pcnce by a poor
S wlfr thatl new no more a precious stone, than did AEsbp's cock, And
zgzlthou h this people hare made no plantations with their arms, yet wc sce
the reputation of them such, as not only their forces have been employed ariel
waged, but their alliance song ht and purchased by the greatest kin gs and states
of Europe. So as though fortune, as it fares sometimes with princes to their
servantS, harh denied them a grant of lands, yet she harh granted them liberal
pensions, which are made memorablc and renoxx ned to van posterity, by the
event which ensued to Lewis the ικκ elfth, κι 110 being prcfled uneivilly by
messagc from thern for the inhauncing their² penfionS, entered mro choler and
broke out into these words, that ⁷ will thest’ villains of the mountains
put a tax upon me ? which words cost him his duehy of Milan, and utterly
ruined his affairs ιιι Ital ι NeirI’rer were it indeed possible at this day, that
that nation should [ubl-st κκ ithout descents and impreffions upon their
neighbours, were it not for the great ut teranee of people which they make
into the services of foreign princes, and estates, thereby discharging not only
number, but in that number, such spirits as are most stirriug and turbulent.

A Nn therefore we may conclude, that as largencss of territory sever-'d
from military virtue, is but a burdem so that treasure and riches sever'gi
from the same, is but a prcy. It resteth therefore to make a reduction of this
error also unto a trurh by distinction and limitation, which will be in this
manner z

TR E As UR E and monies do then add. true greatness and strength to a state,
when they are accompanied with these three conditions:

F1Rsr, The same condition which harh been annexed to largeness οῗ

territory, that 15, that they be joined with martial prowess and valour.

§acono-rr, That treasure doth rhen advance greatncss, when it iatather

in mediocrity than in grear abundanee. And again better, when some
part of the state is poor, than when all parts of it are rich.

A Nn lastgr, That treasure in a state is more or less serviceable‚ as the hands

are in which the wcalth chiefly resteth.

Fon the first of these, it is a thing that cannot be denicd, that in equality
ol xalour, the better pursc 15 an adv· ⁷antage. For like as in wrestling, between
man and man, 'if there be a great οκ ermatch' m strength, it 15 to little purpose,
thouO ih one h ive the better breath3 but if the strength bc near equa1‚ then he
that 15 shorter w inded will (if the wager cons st of many falls) 111 the end have
the worst : lo it 15 111 the wars, if it be a match between a valiant people and
:t cowardly, the advantage of treasure will not servc; but if they be near in
inilour, then the better monied state, will be the better able to continue the

war,
