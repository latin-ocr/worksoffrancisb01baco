ther discoveries, may be at last fairly deduced. In this way,
experiments and reasonings grow up together, to support and
illustrate each other mutually‚ in every part of science. ·

As we are now approaching towards the most memorable 2212.ssst
event of our Author's public life, which ended in a melancholy W*
reverse of his fortune and honour, it will be neeeffary to trace,
step by step, the causes that produced it: especially as the affair
haonot been hitherto considered in the point of view that ren-
dere* it most· interesting and instructive. It will„ I believe, ap-

r⁹ wirhz evidence, that, whatever his crimes might be, he
was ffic'rificed ro the safety of another, far more crimina] than*

the only dupe. A great share of learning he certainly·- had,
but of learning that a King ought not to be acquainted with ;>
the very refuse of the schools, which served for little else but to
furnish him with an impertinent fluency‚ on every subject:
