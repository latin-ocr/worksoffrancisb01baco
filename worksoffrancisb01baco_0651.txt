Lver or stream sheweth white at a distance, and crystalline glafl'es delivcr the

sthe light, altering the intermedium, or affceiing the eye it self, it renelieth
„non Eut you must free your dire-&ion to the producing of such an incident-e,
„impression or operation, as may cause a precise and determinate pallion ot'
⁴,the eye, a matter which is much more easy to induce than that which we hare
pastthrougln but yet because it hath a full coherence both with that aet ol'
radiation (which harh hitherto been conceived and termed so nnproperlv :ind
,untruly, by some an effluffion of spiritual specics, and by Others an investing
of the intermedium, with a motion which succcffively is conveyed to the cye3)
„and with the a& of sense, wherein Ι should likewise open that which 1 think
§goodto withdraw, I will omit. N either do 1 contend, but that this notion‚
*which 1 call the freeing of a direction in the received philosophics, as far
ωε azswimming anticipation could take hold, might be perceived and discern-
,1ed5 being not much other matter, than that which they did not only aim at
vnist-tlte tworules of axioms before remembred, but more nearly also than that
,iffi-hich they term the form or formal cause, or that which they call the true
„djffcrences both which nevertheless it seemeth they propound rather as impos-
sssiibilities and wishes, than as things within the compass of human comprehen-
fffion: for Plato casteth his burden, and saith, that he will revere lum as a
ἶβοά, that can truly divide and define ς which cannot be but by true forms
{find differences, wherein Ι join hands with him, confessing as much, as yet
salsuming to my sclf little3 for if any man can, by the strength of his anti-
cipations, find out forms, I will magnify him with the foremost. But as any
of them would say, that if divers thingS, which many men know by in-
struction and observation, another knew by revelation, and without those
,means they would take him for somewhat supernatural and divine3 so Ι do
fls-acknowlcdge, that if any man can by anticipations rcaeh to that which'a
rweak and inferior wit may attain to by interpretation, he cannot receive
'too high a title. Nay, lfor my part do indeed admire to sec how far some
*ofthcm have procecded by their anticipations3 but how? it is asI wonder
{at some blind men to see what shift they make without their cyesight5 think-
ing with my self that if 1 were blind I could hardly do it. Again, Arg'f'lotle's
school conferrem, that there is no true knowledge but by causes, no truc
cause but the form, no true form known except one, which they are
pleased to alloxv5 and therefore thus far their evidence standeth with us,
‚that both hitherto there harh been nothing bnt a ssiadow of knowledge,
rind that wc propound now that which is agreed to be worthiest to bc fought,
va‘ud hardest to be found, there wanteth now a part very neccffary, not by
way of supply, but by way of cantion: for as it is seen for the most part,
'that the outward tokens and badge ofexcellency and pei-fection arc more
>incident to things merely conntcrfeit, than to that which is truc, bnt sot
{1 meaner and bafer sort5 as a dubline is more like a perfec] ruby than a l'pinel,
