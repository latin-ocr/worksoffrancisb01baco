FILUM LAB-YRlN-TH1.2

and use and praeiicc, and the referring of scienccs thereunto 5 they mean ῖς,
of application of that which is known, and not of a discovery of that which isr ⁴
unknown. So he saw plainly, that this mark, namely, invention os fui-‘-
ther means to indow the condition and life of man with new powers or
works, was almost never yet set up and resolved in man's intention and,
enquiry.

6. HE thought also5 that amongst other knowledges, natural philosoph-m ι
hath been the least followed and labourcd. For since the christian saith, ,the
greatest number of wits have been employed, and the greatest hclps and rer
⁸wards have been converted upon divinity. And before-time likewise, the—
grcatest part of the studies of philosophers was consumed in moral philosophy,
(vhich was as the heathen divinity. And in both times a great part osthe
best wits betook themselves to law, pleadings, and causes of estate 3 speciallyr
in the time of the greatness of the Romans, who by reason of their large
cmpire, needed the service of all their able men for civil business. And the
tirne amongst the Grecians, in which natural philosophy scemed' most to.
flourish, was but a short space5 and that also rather abused in diffcring fests.
and conflisls of opinionS, than profitably spent- Since which time, natural·
philosophy was never any profession, nor never poss'efi'ed any whole man,
except perchance some monk in a cloystcr, or some gentleman in the coun-z
try, rand that very rarely ; but became a science of passage, to seasou. alittlev
young and unripc wits, and to serve for an introduction to other arts‚ speci—'-
ally phy-fiel< and the praffical mathematicks. So as he saw plainly, thatim--
turalaephilosbphy harh been intended by few persons, and in them hathoccufl
pied the least part of their time 3 and that in the wcakest of their age and..
jndgment. , · ·

7‘. HE thought also, how great opposition and prejudice natural philoso-⁴v
phy had received by superstition, and the immoderate and blind zeal of teliz
gi0n3 for he found that some of the Grecl'mzs, which first gave the reason
of thunder, had been condemned of impiety ς and that the Cosmographers,
which first discovered and described the roundncss of the carth, ancl the con-
sequence thereof touching the Antzpodes, were not much otherwise cen-
sured by the ancient fathers of the christian church ς and that the case is now
much worse, in regard of the boldness of the schoolmen and their depen-
danccs in the monasteries, who having made divinity into an art, have almost
incorporated the contentious philosophy of Aristotle into the body ofchti-
stian religion3 and generally he perceived in men of dcvout simplicity this
opinion, that the secrets of nature were the secrcts of God3 and part of
that glory whereinto the mind of man, if it scel< to prcs5‚ shall be oppressed3
and that the desire in men to attain to so great and hidden knowledge, harh
a resemblance with that temptation which caused the original fall; and on
the 'other side, in men of a devout policy, he noted an inclination to have
the peoplc depend upon God the more, when they arc less acquainted With„
second causeS3 and to have no ssirring in philosophy, lcst it may karito-an
innovation in divinity, or else should discover matter of further contradic-
tion to divinity. But in this part, resorting to the authority of the scrip-
tures, and holy examples, and to reason, he ‘'restcd not satisficd alone, but:
much confirmed. For first, he considered that the knowledge of nat ure, by
the light whcreof man discerncd of every living creature, and imposcd names
according to their propi-icty, was not the occasion of the fall 3 but the moral
knowledge of good and evil, affe&ed to the end to dcpend no more upon
Gea's commandmcntS, but for man to dire& himself. Neither could hc
