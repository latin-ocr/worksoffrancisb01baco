OF THE {NTERBRETATION

whole history and observation of eoioutsffand objects vilible, were too long
a distressiom and our purpose is now tegit-e: an example-or* a free ditectioh>

pretation how to reeovcr and attain it. But >as we intend not now tore-
vcal, so we are circumspect not to missead3 and therefore (this xzssnrnitig
being given) returning to our purpose in hand, we admit the fitx‘th direffiion
to bc, that all bodies, ot parts of bodies, which arc unequal equally, rh‘at
is, in a simple proportion‚ do represent whiteness÷ we will explain this,
though we induce it not. It is then to be understood, that absolute* e-
quality produceth transparence‚ inequality in fimple order or proportior} pro·
duceth whitencss, inequality in compound or respeffive order or proportion
produceth other coIours, and absolute or orderlessincquality produccth· black-
ness‘3 which diversity, if so gross a demonstration be needful, may b'e {igni-
fied by four tables; a blank, a chequer, a fret, and a medley3 whcreof 'the
fret is evident to admitgrcat variety. Out of this assei-tion are satisli'ed a
multitude of effects and observations, as that whiteness and blackness :nemost
incompatible with transparence3 that whitencss keepeth light, and black-
ness stoppeth light, but neither paffeth it; that whitcncss or blacknessa're
never produced in rainbows, diamonds, crystalS, and the likc; that white giveth
nodye, and black hardly taketh dyes thatwhireness seemethtohaveanaffinity
with dryness, and blackness with moisture3 that adustion causcth blackness',=‘a1'id
calcination whiteness 3 that flowcrs are generally of frelh colours, and ra'r’ely
black, &a all which Ι do now mention confusedly by way of derivatim, :ind
not by way of induffion. This fixth diteffion, which Ι have thus explained, is 'of
good and competent liberty, for whiteness fixed and inherent 3- but not *for
whiteness fantastical‚ or appearing, as shall be afterwards touched. But first
,do you need a redufflon back to certainty or verity? fot it is nor all posi-tion
or contexture of unequal bodies that will produce colom-ss for Aquafortis‚
oil of Vitriol‚ &c. more manifestly, and 'many other substances more obscurent,
do confist ofvery uncqual parts, which yet are transparent and clear. Therefo're
the redufflon must be, that the bodies orparts of bodies so intermingled as before,
be of a certain gross'ncss or magnitude3 for the unequalities which move thestght
must have a further dimension and quantity, than those which operate many
other effed'ts. Some few grains of saffron will give a tineture to a tun'of
water, but so many grains of civet will give a pcrfume to a whole chamber
of air. And therefore when Democritus (from whom Epicurus did bo'r-
row it) held that the position of the solid portions was the cause of colours;
yet in the very truth of this ass'ertion he should have added, that the portions
are required to be of some magnitude. And this is one cause why colours
have little inwardnc& and neccssitude with the nature and propt-ietics of
things, those things resemblingin colour, which otherwise differ mo'st, as salt
and sugar3 and contrariwise differing in colour, which otherwise resemble
most, as the white and blue violcts‚ and the several veins of one agate or
marblc, by reason that other virtues consist in more subtile proportions than
colours do3 and yet are their virtues and nattum, which require a gross'e'r
magnitude than colours, as well as scents· arrd divers other require a more
subtil& sor as the portion of a body will give forth scent, which is too small
to be seen, so the portion osa body will lhcw colours, which is too small
to be cndued with weight: and therefore one of the prophets with great e—
legancy delei-ibing how all creatures carry no proportion towards God the
creator, saith, that all the nations in respez‘? of him are like the dzglt‘ qspo‘n
