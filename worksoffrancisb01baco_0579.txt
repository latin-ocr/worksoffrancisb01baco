situation of the region or place.

W HEREIN 1 mean nothing superstitioussy touehing the fortunes or fatal
deffiny of any placeS, nor philosophically touching their configuration with

Secondly, that it be seated in no extreme angle, but commodioussy in the

, upon great navigable rivers; and be not inland or mediterrane. And that

tlfflse are not conceits, but notes of event, it appeareth manifestly, that all
gi‘ea't monarchies and states have been scated in such manner, as if you would

cannot place them better3 which {hews the preheminence of nature, unto
w‘hich human industry or accident cannot be equal, specially in any con-

about the places, coming and going only in regard of the fixed reason of
the conveniency of the place, which is immutable. And therefore first we
see· the excellent situation of Eg ypt3 which secmeth to have been the most
anticnt monarchy, how conveniently it stands upon a neck of land com-
manding both scas on either fide, and embracing as it were with two arms,
Asia and Afrz‘ck, besides the benefit of the famous river of Nilus. And
therefore we see what hath been the fortune of that country, there having
been'two mighty returns of fortune, though at great distance of time, the
one in the times of Sesbstris, and. the other in the empire of the Mamalukes,
belides the middle greatncss of the kingdom of the Ptolemys, and of the
greatness of the caliphs and sultans in the latter times. And this region, we
see likewise, is of strait and defensible access, being commonly called of the

and northern and southern regions. And therefore we see that although the
sovereignty alter, yet the seat still of the monarchy remains in that place.
For after the monarchies of the kings of Affyria‚ which were natural kings
of that place, yet when the foreign kings of ‘Perfia came in, the scat re-
mained. For although the mansion of the persons of the kings of Persia
were sometimes at Susa, and sometimes at Ecbatana, which were tcrmed
their winter and their summer parlours, because of the mildness of the air in
the one, and the frelhness in the orbem yet the city of estate continued to be
Babylon. Therefore we see, that Alexander the Great, according to the
advice of Calanus the Indian‚ that ffiewed him a bladder, which if it were
borne down at one end, would rise at the other, and therefore wished him
to keep ‘himself in the middle of his empne, chose accordingly Babylon for

his seat, and died there. And afterwards likewise in the family of Seleucus
