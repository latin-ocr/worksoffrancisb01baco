THELIFE OF‘THE

the pontifical chair osten filled with men, who, instead
of adorning their sacred chamaer, made human nature -i-jr self
detestable: a truth by many catholic writers aeknowledged
and lamented. Several Popes were, by their sueceffors ex-
communicated, their aas abrogated, and the sacranients ad-
ministred by them pronounced invalid. No less than fix
were expelled by others who usurped their seat3 two were
affaffinated: and the infamous Theodora, infamous even in-that
age, by her credit in the holy city, obtained the triple crown
for the most avowed of her gallants‚ who affumed the nameof
John the Tenth. Another of the same name was ealledato
govern the Christian world at the age of twenty one3 a
bastard son of Pope Sergius who died eighteen years before.
If such were the men who arrogated to themselves titles and at-
tributes peculias to the Deity, can we wonder at the greatest “
enormities among Lay-men? Their stupidity kept pace with
the diffolution of their manners, which was extreme: >they
still preserved, for the very clergy we have been speaking of, ‘a
reverence they no longer had for their God. The most aban-
doned among them, misereants, familiar with crimes that hu-
manity startles at, would yet, at the hazard of their lives, de-
fend the immunities of a chureh, a consecrated utenfil‚ or a
donation made to a convent. In such times as those, it were
in vain to look for useful learning and philosophy. Not only
the light of seleuce, but of reason, seems to have been well-
nigh extinguished.

IT was not till late, after the sack of Constantinople by the
Darks, that the writings of Aristode began to be universally
known and studied. They were then, by certain fugitive?
Greeks, who had escaped the fury of the Ottoman Arms,
brought away and dispersed thro the W eastern parts of Europe. ι
Some particular treatises of his, it is true, had been long made
publie; but chiefly in transsations from the Arabia done by
