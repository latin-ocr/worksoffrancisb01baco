mendams, he behaved himself with the honesty and firmness
of one who knew that a Judge ought neither to be flattered nor.
menaced out of his integrity. Towards the latter part of *h'is
life, he struck in with the country party in parliamentsand
stood in the breach against the arbitrary measures of Jame-sand ,
Clmrles. He died in the reign of the latter, aged 88 years, J Ι

AT length Sir Francis Bacon obtained the place he had so·

Amffioss, long expected: and in 1607 was declared Solicitor*G[enjetad.>

W This preserment was the effect of many letters and much ,in-

stance on hjs part, to the Earl of Salisbmy, the Lord Chanf

cellor Egerton, and the King himself. Neither dol find that'

he was ever promoted to any post without repeated and earnes}

application to ministers and favourites: a reflection that may¹

serve at once to mortify‚ and instruet an ambitious man :of

p JAMEs had, from the beginning of his reign, paffionatefy
defired an union of Scotland and England .· but his unrea-
sonable partiality to the former, reckoning it as an equal hals
of the issand, rendered the defign abortive. Tho Sir Francis}
Bacon laboured this argument with all the arts of wit and rea-
son, his eloquence, powerful as it WaS, had no effe& on the·
house of Comrnons. The Parliament even shewed itself averse
to this union, in proportion as the Court appeared zealous foi·⁴
it. The new Sovereign's conduct had alarmed them. Thssy,
saw, that, with a strong disposition to be profuse, he was abso,—
lutely in the power of favourites ; and that some of the least
valuable among his subjeets were most in his favour. They saw
farther‚ that he began already to propagate maxims of govern*
ment destruetive to liberty, and inconfistent with the whole
tenor of the constitution. These things filled observing men
with apprehenfions for the future, which unhappily werevbut
too well founded. The whole sum of his polines, both now and
afterwards was to distaste and alienate his subjersts at homef>3
to dishonour both himself and them abroad. lt was a reign of

embaffies and negociationS‚ alike fruitless and expenfive: ‚a

reign of favourites and proclamations‚ of idle amusements and

arbitrary impositions. It was besides the great era of flattery.
