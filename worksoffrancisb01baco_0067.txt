LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. ‚xlv

live to himself, and for the advantage, not of one age, or one
people only, but of all mankind, and all times to come.

THE first considerable work hc engaged in, after his re- mmm,
tirement, was the history of Hemy Vll. which he undertook at m
the defire of King Jamw, and publiihed in the year 1622.
Whatever some writers may have insinuared of his melancholy
and dejeetion, we find every where, in this performance‚ evi-
dent traces of a spirit unhroken by age, and unsubdued by
missortunes. It has been highly applauded‚ and as much
condemned: a proof that it has more than common merit.
And we may venture to affirm that whatever its faults are,
they arife from no want of vigour in the understanding, or of
warmth in the imagination of the writer. King Jemes affected
to confidet his great grandfather Henry as a perfect model for
the imitation of other Monarchs: and as his was the reign of
flattery, this quickly grew to be the prevalent and fashionable
opinion at Court. Tho in truth, that Prince's charaeter waS,
in every part of it, unamiable3 and his conducst, on many
occafionS, weak or wicked. If my Lord Bacon has not
wholly escaped the infeecion of his age3 if he has here and
there attempted to brighten the imperfectioris, and throw in
shades the bad features of the original he was drawing 3 yet,
thro these sostening8‚ we can eafily see this King as he was,
and in all his genuine deformity.v Suspicion and avarice, his
own historian acknowledges, were the chief ingredients in his
composition: and therefore his politics, both at home and
abroad, were narrow, selfish, and false. Void of all great and
extensive prudence, he endeavoured to supply that want by
temporary ssiifts‚ and the little expedients of cunning. By
these he commonly had the luck to extricare himself out of amn, voi.
difficultie3‚ which a wiser man would have timely foreseen,¹1¹·f'·400·
and a better man have wholly prevented. But as his genius
was unsociable and solitary, the darkness in his temper paffed
on mankind for depth and sagacity in his understanding. His p, 404,
avarice too, was sordid and shamelefs. Nothing seemed
mean, nothing unjust in his eyes, that could fill his coffers:
and merely to fill them, for of wealth he had no enjoyment‚
he descended to arts of rapine no less scandalous than they
were oppreffive.
