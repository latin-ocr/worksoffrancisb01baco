LORD BACON.

 

ΜΓ. Bacon in praise of Knowledge.

ILENCE were the best celebration of that, whichI mean to com-
· mend, for who would not use silence, where s lence is not made3 and
, ’ what cryer can mike silence in such a noise and tumult of vain and
popular opinions? My praile {hall be dedicated to the mind itself. The
mind 1s the man, and the knowledge of the mind. A man is but what
he knoweth. The mind itlelf is but an accident to knowledge3 for know-
ledge is a double of that which is. The truth of being, nand the trut'h
of knowing, is all one. And the pleasures of the affcffions greater than
the pleasures² of the senses. And are not the pleasurcs of the intellest
greater than the pleasures of the affcffions? Is it not a true and only na-
7 tura} plealure‚ whereof there is no laticty? Is it not knowledge that dot'h
alone clear the mind of all perturbations? How many things arc there
which we imagine not? How many things do we esteem and valuc other-
wise than they are? This ill-proportioned estimation‚ these vain imagi-
nastons, these be the clouds of error that turn into the storms of pertur-
bation. Is there any such happiness as for a man's mind to be raised above
the' confusion of things; where he may have the prospect of the order of
nature, and the error of men? Is this but a vein only of delight, and nor
of discovery: of contentment‚ and not of benefit? Shall we not as well
distem the riches of nature’s warehouse, a's the benefit of her shop? Is
trurh ever barren? Shall henot be able thereby to produce worthy effe-Cts‘,
and 1ο endow the life of man with infinite commodities? But ffiall Imake
this garland to be put upon a wrong head ? would any body believe me,
'16⁷1 ffiould verify this, upon the knowledge thar is now ih use ἶ Are' we
the richer by one poor invention, by reason of all the learning that harh
been· these many hundred years? The industry of artificers maketh some
frnall‘ improvement of things invented3 and chance sometimes in experi-
menting, maketh us to stnmble upon somewhat which is new: But all the
disputation of the learned never brought to liunt one effe& of na'ture be-
fore unknown. 11711611 things are known and found out, then they can
descant upon them, they can knit rhem into certain causes, they can rc-
duce them to their principles. lf any instance of expetience stand ag vainst
them, they ean range it in order by lome distinctions. But all this is but
a web of the wit, it can work nothing. Ido not doubt but that com-
