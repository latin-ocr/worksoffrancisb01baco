in his grand Instauration of the sciences. As there is not a
more amusing, perhaps a more usesul speculation‚ than that
os tracing the history of the human mind, if ,Ι may so express
my self, in its progreffion from truth to truth, and from dis-
covery to discovery 3 the intelligent vreader would doubtless
have been pleased to see, in the tra& Ι am speaking of, by
. what steps and gradations a spirit like Bacon's advanced in
building up, for more than thirty years, together, his
new and universal theory. He thought himself born for the
use of human kind: and in the letter above mentioned, stiles
himself, the servant of posterity: ‚

THESE few hints for filling up this first part ofour Author's
life, trivia] and unsatisfacstory as¹ they may appear, I have yet
been obliged to glean here and there in the rubbish of several
collefiions, where they lay scattered, without order or con-
nection. But Ι shall now no longer regard Bacon as a mere
philosopher ; as a man of speculation who conversed only with
books and his own thoughts, in the shade of retirement and lei—
sure. The course of his fortunes produced him on the great
theatre of the world, involvedhim in business, and complicated
him with the most considerable persons of the age he lived in.
He was honourably employed by one Prince, and highly pre‘
serred under another. lt will be therefore necessary, that this
history may have its due extent and usefulness‚ to exhibit a ge·
neral prospec't of the two reigns in which Bacon flourished
and fell, at least in their principal points of view. The
charaeters of those with whom he had any connee'tion will
illustrate his, and show it in a truer, as well as a fuller light.

I HAvss yct another reason for enlarging this account beyond
the ordinary limits. Our Author's letters are written, many of
them at least, on public< occasionS, and may be considered as
the most authentic vouchers for several remarkable occurrences,
in which he himself was an a&or‚ and vwell acquainted with
the secret motivcs on which others ae'ted. But as those things
are for the most part only hin-ted at, or no farther opened than
to serve the present purpose of his letter3 they will require to be
developed at some length, and ranged into their proper places.
