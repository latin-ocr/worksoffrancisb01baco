war, ‘and so in the end to prevail. But if ειηγλ man think that money cari
make those provisions at the first encounters‚ that no differenee of valour can
countervail,· let him look back but, into. those examples which have been
brought, and he must confess, that all those furnitures jwhatsoever are but ssaews
and mummeries, and cannot lhrowd feara'gainst resolution. For there shall he
find companies armed with armour of proofttaken out of the stately armories

· ’ὡῌοιμὼε second point, that competency of treasure is better than sur-fcit,
ἷξε matter of common place or ordinary discourse3 in regatd that excess of
’ σε, neither in publici< nor private, -ever hath any good effests‚ but makcth
geneither ssothful and effeminate, and so no enterprizers; or insolent or
ffimgant, and so over-great embracers3 but most generally cowardly and

'fgatfill to lose, according to the adage, szidns Plutus, so as this needcth
130 further speech. But a part of that assertioii requireth a more deep con-
fideration, being a matter not so familiar, but yet most affuredly true.v For
it2is necessary in a state that shall grow and inlarge, that there be that composi-
tjon which the poet speaks of, Multis utile bellum, an ill condition of a state
ssno question) isit be meant of a civil war, as it was spoken; but a condition
proper to a state that shall encrease, if it be taken of a foreign war. For
{geept there be a spur in the state, that shall excite and prick them on to wass,
they will but keep their own, and secl< no further. And in all expericnce and
stories you shall find but three things that prepare and dispose an estate to war3
the ambition of governourS, a state of soldiers profeffed, and the hard means to
llye of many subjeets. Whereof the last is the mostforcible and the most con-
stant. And thisis the true reason of that event which we observed and rehearsed
before, that most of the great kingdoms of the world have sprung out of
h‘a'rdness and scarceness of means, as the strongcst hcrbs out of the barrenest
soils. ¹

κ FOR the third point coneerning the placing and distributing of treasure in
a state‚- the position is simple, that then treasure is greatest strength to a state,

'when it is so dffposed, as it is readiest and easiest to come by for publici< service
and use3 which one position cloth infer three conclusions.

„f F1s1‘w, that there be quantity sufficient of treasure as well in the treasury
of the crown or state, as in the purse of the private subjeet.

, δεοοΝοιΥ, that the wealth of the subject be rather in many hands than

'sparing‚ and enerease, and not in those hands, wherein there useth to be
greatest expence and consumption.

‚. Fon it is not the abundant-e of treasure in the snbiefts hands that can make
sudden supply of the want of a state, because reason tells ns, and experience
both, that private persons have least will to contribute‚ when they have most
cause3 for when there is noise or expectation of wars, then is always the
‘deadcst times for moines, in regard every manrestraincth and holdeth fast his
means for his own comfort and succour‚ according, as Salomon saith, The
riches osa man are as astr07lgl110ld in his own imaginatjon ,ς and therefore
