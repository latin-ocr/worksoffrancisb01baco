xxvi THE LIFE OF THE

as may serve to throw some light on this dark transaction, tho
not enough perhaps to discover the darker motivcs that in-
fluenced the King’s and the Earl’s behaviour in it.
m v01. JAMEs himself seledoed certain persons to examine Somerfim
with all-secrecy, and marked out to them the particular articles
on which they were to interrogate him. They had withal
orders to work upon his obstinate temper by every method of
persuafion and terror: to give him now hopes of the King's
compassion and mercy3 and now to assure him that the evi—
dence was full to convi& him, so as there needed neither con-
'ol-IV- fession nor supply of examination. Bacon, who was one of
m ’ them, adds that they found his deportment sober and modest,
differing apparently from other times, In another letter he has
these remarkable words: “ That same little charm which may
“ be secretly infused into Somerset's ear some hours before his
“ tryal was excellently well thought of by his Majesty: only Ι
“ could wish it a little enlarged3 for if it be no more but to
“ spare his blood, he hath a kind of proud humour that may
“ over-work the medicine.” All this was to be done with
much cantion and privacy3 for the very Serjeants, appointed to
manage part of the tryal, were not yet in the secret how the
King would have it carried on: and therefore Heleon, to cover
stom them what he knew of the matter, defired that some ge-
neral heads of direfflon might be sent to thern all. From hence
it appears that James shewed an extreme solicitude about the
Earl's behaviour‚ and the event of this affair. To what can it be
attributed? His affec‘tion for Some7ss2t was extinguished: and he
lay under the strongest obligations of public honour and justioe
not to screen‚ from the censure of the law, a man whose guilt
was of the most crying enormity. The Earl’s standing mute,
or denying that guilt‚ especially as the proofs of it were strong
and pregnant‚ could bring no possible imputation on his name.
Why then all this dark praefice? a.ll these artifices of the persons
who examined him, only to make him submit to be tried, and
etter133. to keep him in due temper during his tryal? There is still
more. James ordered his Attorney·General to forecast and put
in writing every poffible case with regard to the tryal, and ac·-
company them with his own opinion on each; that no surprize
might happen, but that things duly foreseen might have their
diref'tions and remedies in readiness. Accordingly Sir Francis
Bacon
