A DlscoU'RSE ΙΝ PRAISE

take the most proper and naturaltrial of her royal clemcncy? will it best appear
in the injurics that were done unt o her before she attained the crown? or
after she is seated in her throne? or that the commonwcalth is incorporated
in her person ? Then elcmcncy is drawn in question, as a dangcrous eneoun-
ter of justice and policy. And therefore, who did ever note, that {he did
relent (after that she was establilbed in her kingdom) of the wrongs done
unto her former estate ἓ XVho doth not remembet how ihc did revenge the
rigour and rudeness of her jaylor by a word, and that no bittcr but salt,
and such as shewed rather the excellcncy of her wit, than any imprcffionof
her wrong? Yea, and further, is it' not so manifest, ‘that since her reign,
notwithstanding the principle that Princes should not neglcCt that the Com
monwealth's wrong is included in themfi’lves ‚- yet when it is question of
drawing the sword, there is ever a conflist between the justice of her place
joined with the neceflity of her state and her royal clemency, which as a
sovereign and precious balm continually distilleth from her fait hands, and fal· -
leth into the wounds of many that have incurred the offenee of her law. ¹ ι
N ow, for her bcneficence, what kind of persons have breathed during ,·
her most happy reign, but have had the benerit of her virtues conveyect:
unto them? Take a view, and eonfider, whether they have not extendedv
ro subjeecs, to neighbours, to remote strangerS, yea, to her greatest ene—
mies. For her subjeets, where shall we begin iu such a maze of benefits2
as presenteth itself to remcmbrance? Shall we speak of the purging away
of the dross of religion, the heavcnly treasure3 or that of money, the
earthly treasure? The greater was touched before, and the latter deserveth
not to be forgotten. For who believeth not (that knoweth any thing in
matter of estate) of the great absurdities and frauds that arise of divorcing
the legal estin-ration of moncys from the general, and (as Ι may term it) ’
natural estimation of the metals, and again of the uncertainty and waver-
ing mlucs of coins, a very labyrinth of cousenages and abuse, yet such as'>
great Princes have made their profit of towards their own people. Pars
on from the Mjnt to the revenue and receipts: there shall you find, no·
raising of rents, notwithstanding the alteration of prices and the usage of
the timcs; but the over-value‚ besides a reasonable fine left for the relies of
tenants and reward of servants; no raifing of eustoms notwithstanding her ⁴
continual charges of setting to the [ρας no extremity taken of forfeitur‘e ¹
and penal laws, means used by some Kings for the gathering of great treas
¹sures. A few forfeitures indeed, not taken to her own purfe, but see
over to some others for the trial only, whether gain could bring those ‘laws '
to be well executed, which the ministers of justice did neglect. But after
'it was found, that only compaffions were used, and the law never the nearcr
the execution, the course was straight supprcffed and discontinucd. Yea,
there have been made laws more than one in her time for the restraint of
the vexation of informers and promotcrs: nay, a course taken by het
own dircstion for the repealing of all heavy and snared laws, if it had not
been cross'ed by those to whom the benefit should have rcdounded. There
ihall you find, no new taxes, impositions, nor deviccs; but the bencvolencc of
the subje& frcely offered by assent of parliament according to the ancient '
rates, and with great moderation in ass'ess'ment3 and not so only, but some
new forms of contribution offered likewise by the subject in parliamcnt3‘
and the demonstration of their devotion only accepted, but the thing never
put in ure. There {hall you find loans, but honourably answered and paid
