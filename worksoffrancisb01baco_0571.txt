OF *BR-ITAINi*

any great kernel or nur, but to one of the least grains, but yet such a one,
ns harh a property to grow and spread. For as for large countries and
multitude of provinces, they are many times rather matters of bui-den than
-of strength, as may manifestly appear both by reason and example. By
reason thus. There be two manners of secui-ing of large territoricS, the
‚one by the natural arms of every province, and the other by the pi·ote&iiig
3}th of the principal estate, in which case commonly the provincials are
held disarmed. So are there two dangcrs incident unto every estate, foreign
invasion, and inward rebellion. Now such is the nature os things, that
those two remedies of estate do fall rcfpcffivcly into these two dangers, in case
of remote provinccsz For if such an estate rest upon the natural arms of the
provinces, it issure to be subJeet to rebellion or revolt ς if upon protcCting arms,
jtis, sure to be weak against invasion: neither can this be avoided. Now
for examples, proving the weakncss of states poss'ess'cd of large territories‚ 1
ywill use only two, eminent and felested. The first shall be of the kingdom
ofiPmfia, which extended from Egypt inclusive unto Banna, and the
horders of the East India, and yet neverthcless was over—run and conqucrcd
in the space of seven yearS‚ by a nation not much bigger than this isse of
Britain, and newly grown into name, having been utterly obscure till the
time of Philip the son of Amyntas. N either was this effected by any rare
or heroieal prowess in the conqueror, as is vulgarly conceived (for that
Alexander the Great goeth now for one of the wonders of the world ς) for
those that have made a iudgment gronndcd upon reason of estare, do find
that conceit to be mecrly popular, for so Livy pronounceth of him, nihil
aliud quam bene ansits vana contemnere. Wherein he iudgeth of vastness
of territory as a vanity that may astonilh a weak mind, but no ways trouble
a found resolution. And those that are conversant attentively in the
histor-ies of those times, ssaall find that this purchase which Alexander made
and compassed, was offered by fortune twice before to others, though by
accident they went not through with it3 namer, to Agesilaus and Jasbn
of Theffizly: 'for Agesilaus, after he had made himself master of most of the
low provinces of Asta, and had both design and commillion to invade the
higher countries, was diverted and called home upon a war excited against
his country by the states of Athens and Thebes, being incensed by their
orators and couiisellors, which were bribed and corrupted from Perss'cz, as
Agcfilaus himself avouehed pleasanssy, when he said, that an hundred
thousand archers of the King of Perstat, had driven him home3 understanding
it, because an archer was the stamp upon the ”Persian coin of gold. And
Jasbn of Theffaly being a man born to no greatness‚ but one that made
a fortune of himself, and had obtained by his own vivacity of spirit joined
with the opportunities of time, a great army eompounded of voluntat-ies
and adventurm-s, to the terror of all Graecia, that continually expected
where that cloud would fall; diselosed himself in the end, that his delign
was for an expedition into Perfia (the same which Alexander not many
years after archieved) wherein he was interrupted by a private conspiracy
against his life, which took effect. So that it appetite-th, as was said, that it
was not any miracle of accident, that raised the Macedonian monarchy, but
only the weak composition of that vast state of Persia, which was prepared
for- a prey to the first resolute invader.

Tus second example that Ι will produce, is of the Roman empne, which

had received no diminution in territory, though great in virtue and forces,
