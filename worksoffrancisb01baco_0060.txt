gratify their paffions and lust ofdominion. They, in return, found
out for him a title antecedent and superior to human laws,even
a divine right of being weak or wicked, without controul. And
this doctrine, horrible as it is, they dared to derive from,
scripture: where if it could be found, which to affirm-were
blasphemy, it would be the triumph of infidelity, and demon-⁷,
stration that those sacred writings were inspired, not by God,
but by some Being, his opposite and the enemy of all goodness.5
This doctrine, meeting with his own perverted habits of think-*g
ing, made King James look upon his subjects as ssaves3 upon,
his parliaments as usurpers of a power to which they had ηρ»
right, or at best a precarious one: and he had now, for seven-
years together, affected to govern without them ; to set up an}
interest separate from that of his people‚ and to supply ,his
wants by all ways and meanS, but such as the constitutio&

enemies of the commonwealth, the tribe of projec‘tors and nio-4
nopolists: misereants who sheltered themselves under the name
and influence of Buckingham, and who repaid his protection-
extravagantly, at the expence of a people whom they were·
grinding and devouring. His mother too, now created -a,
Countess in her own right, a woman born for mischief, of , a2
meddling'spirit and insatiably greedy, was deep in the guilt of
these transactions3 forwarding every bad projeci: that brought,
her in money ; and, by the mighty power she had over her son,
succeeding in every scandalous job she undertook. Under-f an
administration like this, when England was in effect governed*
by a diffolute youth, himself in the hands of an intriguing, ra-«ff
pacious woman, it cannot be surprizing that the people were
vexed and plundered by illegal parcum, by monopolies, by other
mischievous projects, calculated to enrich a few, and to ruin
thousands. To all these patents, however procured, the Chan-
661]οι- had readily, almost implicitly, affixed the seal, as the
mere creature of Buckingham : Or if he ever ventured to infir
nuate that any of thern were contrary to law, his remonstranco'
was too fearful and unsupported to produce any effect. This
is the great stain on his character, that he deserted, or neglec'ted,

the post of honour where providence had placed him, on the

frontier, if I may so speak, betwixt Prerogative and Liberty;

that, if he did not encourage, he at least connived at, the
