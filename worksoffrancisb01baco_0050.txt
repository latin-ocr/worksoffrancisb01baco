xxviii THE LIFE OF THEw

peculiar turn. He defires that his estate may be continued to
him intire, in a stile rather of expostulation and demand than
of humility and supplication: and thro the affeeted obscurity
of some expreffions, one may discover, that there was an im-
portant secret in his keeping, of which the King dreaded a
discovery. The iffue was, that James continued to him a
penfion of four thousand pounds a year, as long as he lived,

PRmeE Hem-y died in the year 1 61 2, universally lamented.
His excellent qualities had endeared him to the love and ex-
pectations of all England. Germanicus was not more the
darling of the Roman people z and the untimely death of both,
those Princes was universally believed to have been procured by
poison. He had expreffed, on all occafions, an abhorrence
of minions‚ and an utter contempt of Somerset .· he had even
declared a firm resolution, to humble both him and the family
into which he was allied, is ever he came to reign. Whether
the unaccountable transaction I have been relating has any re-
ference to the death of this amiable Prince, or whether it does
not point rather to an affair of a very different nature, the
reader is left to determine.

VILLIERS, now without a rival in the King's affec'tions, was
every day receiving new proofs of his bounty3 at the same
time that he more than shared with him the exercise of his au·-
thority. In the course of a few years he was made Gentleman
of the Bed-chamber, Master of the Horse, Knight of the Garter
Earl, Marquis and Duke of Buckingham‚ Chief Justice in Eyre’:
of all the Forests, and Lord High Admiral of England. One of
those prodigies of fortune, who rise now and then upon the
world, as the vulgar imagine of cometS, at once to astoniss1
and scourge it: a signal instance of the wantonness of sovereion
power, and how far it may insult human kind in exalting assd
adorning what it should neglect or conternn. He drew up
after him an obscure kindred, numerous and indigent, bestowed
on them places of trust and profit, married them into the no-
blest families, and graced them all with dignities‚ which were
to be supported at the common expence of a whole people3 to
whom if any one of them was merely harmless, it was his ut-
most praise. After having read, not only what the enemies of
this favourite have said against him, but all that his partizans
have alledged on his behalf, I—do not find, during the whole

time
