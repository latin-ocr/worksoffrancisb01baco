tot-heScholastic Philosophy3 that motley offspring Of error
andingenuity: and to speak freely, the features of both pa-
rents were all along equally blended in the complexion of the
. daughter. Tc trace at length the rise, progress, and varia·
tions of this philosophy, would be an undertaking not only cu-
rious but instructive, as it would unfold to us all the mazes in
Which the force, the subtlety, the extravagance of human wit
¹ can lose themselves: till not only profane learning but divinity
itself was at last, by the refined frenzy of those who taught
both, subtilized into mere notion and air.

Tam philosophy was neither that of Aristffltle entirely, nor
altogether differing from his. Whatever opinions the first
founders of it had been able to draw, from Boetius his La-
tin commentator, or from the wretched transsations above-
mentioned, these they methodized and illustrated‚ each accord-
ing to his several talent, and the genius of the age he lived in.
But this, instead of producing one regular and COHfistCnt body
of science, even from wrong principles, ended in a monster,
made up of parts every where mishapen and dissimilar. Add
to this, that they left natural knowledge wholly uncultivated3
to hunt after occult qualitieS‚ abstract notions, and questions of
impertinent curiofity, by which they rendered the very Logic
their labours chiefly turned upon intricate, useless, unin-

revived afterwards m the person of Occam, another of 0111 coun-
trymen‚ and the perpetual antagonist of Dum Semta, who had
declared for the Realists, and was reckoned their ahlest cham-
