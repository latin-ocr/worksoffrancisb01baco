LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. xliii

letter of general confeflion, tho delivered to them by the Prince
of Wales; in which he renounced all justification of him--
self‚ and sued for no other favour, “ but-that his penitent sub-
“ miflion might be his sentence, and the loss of the seals his
“ punissiment.” He was obliged to put in a particular answer
to every point of his accusation ε which he did on the first of
May, 162 1 3 acknowledging‚ in the most explicite words,
the corruption charged upon him in twenty eight several arti- ’
cle3‚ and throxving his cause entirely on the compallion os his
Judges. His sentence waS, ‘⁶ to undergo a fine of forty thou-
“ sand pounds 3 to be imprisoned in the T ower duringthe King's
‘⁶ pleasure3 to be for ever uncapable of any office, place, or em-
“ ployment in the commonwealtl13 and never to fit again in
“ parliament‚ or come within the verge os the court.’' Thus
he lost the great privilege of his peerage3 a severity unusual
except in cases of treason and attainder.

THE last article of his charge furnishes matter for much 're-
flection. It alledges, ‘⁶ that he had given way to great ex-
“ actions in his servants, both in respe& of private seals‚ and

mestics, which was certainly extreme, has been generally, and {L P st
I believe truly, reckoned the principal cause of those irregula- irizlfssg' 0 ⁹
rities that drew on his disgrace. Liberal in his own temper,
or rather profuse beyond the condition of a man who means to
preserve his integrity‚ he allowed his family in every kind of
extravagance: and as many of his retinue were young, diffi-
pated, giddy in the pursuit of pleasure‚ they squandered with-
out measure, where they were indulged without controul'ss,
Whether he did not discover this error till it was too late, or
whether a soul like his, lost in the greatness and immenfity of
its own views, could not attend to that detail of little and dis-
agreeable particulars which yet oeconomy requires3 however
that was, to support his ordinary train of living, he fell into
corruption himself, and connived at it in his dependent& Thus
we behold him, a memorable example of all that is great and
exalted, of all that is little and low, in man. Such incon-
fistencies in our human nature cannot but alarm and terrisy
even those who are most confirmed in a habitos virtue.

AFTER

³¹⁵ One day, during his tryal‚ as he was passing thro a room where several of his

‘domestics were fitting 3 upon their getting up to salute him, Sit down my Masta-s,
