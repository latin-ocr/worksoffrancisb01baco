lifhed‚ touching the administration of this place, because they are some:
what differing from the usage of former times, and yet not by way of novel:
ty, but by way of reformation, and seduction ofthings to their ancient and
'true institution. ,

WHEREIN nevertheless it is his Maiesty's express pleasure it be fignified,
that he understands this to be done, without any derogation from the me·
mory or service of those great persons, which have formerly held this place,
of whose doings his Majesty retaineth a good and gracious remembranee, espe-
cially touching the lineerity of their own minds. Ι

Bur now that his Maiesty meaneth to be as it were Mastcr of the Wasds
himself, and that those that he useth‚ be as his substitutes‚ ancl move wholly
in his motion3 he doth expe& things be carried in a sort worthy of his own
care.

Fmsr therefore his Majesty hath had this princely consideration with
himself, that as he is Pater patriae, so he is by the ancient law of th‘n
kingdom Pater pupillorum, where there is any tenure by knight's service
of himself ; which extendeth almost to all the great families noble and gene-

the subjeets at large. ἲ

Fon the first, his Maiesty harh commanded special care be taken in
the choice of the personS, to whom they be committed, that the same
be sound in religion, such whose houl'cs and familics are not noted fot
dissolute, no greedy persons, no step-motherS, nor the like, and with these
qualifications, of the nearest friends 3 nay further, his Maiesty is mindednot
so to delegate this trust to the commirrces, but that he will have once
in the year at the least, by persons of credit in every county, a view and
inspefflon taken of the persons, houses, woods, and lands of the wards,
and other persons under the protection of this court, and certificate to be
made thereos accordingly.

Fon the suitors‚ which is the second3 his Majcsty’s princely care falls
iipon two points of reformati0n3 the first, that there be an exaniination
of fees, what are due and ancient, and what arc new and exaCted ; and those
of the latter kind put down: the other, that the court do not entertain
