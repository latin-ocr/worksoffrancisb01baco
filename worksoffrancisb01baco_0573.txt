continued and entire, ancl had thickness and squareness in ¹their ‘orb o'r

F οι». the second, concerning the proportion between the principa! region,
aad those which arc but secondary, there must ever more distinction bc made
between the body or stem of the trec, and the boughs and branehes. For
if the top be over great, and the stalk too ssender, there can bc no strength.
Now, the body is to be accounted so much of an estate, as is not separated
or distinguished with any mark of foreigners, but is united s ecially with
the bond of naturalizatiom and therefore we see that when the gare of Rome
grew great, they were enforced to naturalize the Latins or Italiam, because
t'nc Roman stem could no't bear the provinces and Italy both as branches:
and the like they were contented after to do to most of the Gauls. So on the
contrary part we see in the state of Lacedaemon, which was nice in that point,
and would not admit their confederates to be incorporate with them, but tested

⁴upon the natural—born subjeets of Sparta, how that a small time after they had
embraced a lai-ger empire, they were presently surcharged, in respect to the
sscnderness of the stem. For so in the defection of the Thebans and the rest
against them, one of the principal revolters spake most aptly‚ and with great
efficacy in the assembly of the affociatcs‚ telling them, that the state of Sparta
was like a river, which after that it had, run a great way, and taken other rivers
and streams into it, ran strong and mighty, but about the head and fountain of
it was shallow and wcak3 and therefore advised thern to affail and invade the
main of Sparta, knowing they should there find weak resistance either of towns
or in the field: of towns, because upon confidence of their greatness, they
’fortified not upon the main3 in the field, because their peoplc was exhaust
by garrisons a'nd services far off. Which counsel proved found, to the
astonishment of all Graecia at that time. , ,

Fon the third, concerning the proportion of the military forces of a state
to the amplitude of empire, it cannot be better demonstratcd than by the
two first examples, which we produced of the weakness of large territory,
if they be compared within themselves-according to differcncc of time. For
‘Persia at a time was strengthened with large territory, and at another time
weakened3 and so was Rome. For while they flourished in arms, the
largeness of territory wasastrength to them, and added force3‚ added treasures,
added reputation: but when they decaycd in arms, then greatness became a
bur-den. For their protecting forces did corrupt, supplant‚ and enervate the
natural and proper forces of all their provinces, which relied and depended
upon the succours‘ and directions of the state above. And when that waxed
impotent and ssothful, then the whole state laboured with her own magnitude,
and in the end fell with her own wcight. And that no question was the
reason of the strange inundations of pcople which both from the east and
northwest overwhelmed the Roman empirc in one age of the world, which
a man upon the sudden would attribute to some constellation or fatal
revolution of time, being indeed nothing else but the declination of the
Roman empire, which having effeminated and made vile the natural strength
of the province3‚ and not being able to supply it by the strength imperial
and sowi-eiga, did as a lure cast abroad, invite and eutice all the nations
adjacent, to make their fortuncs upon her dccays. And by the same
reason, there cannot but ensue a diffolution to the state of the Turk, in
regard of the largeness of empire, whcnsoever their martial virtue and

discigi‘nelihall be further rdaxed, {Rercof the time secmethto αρριοεῖεὲιὲ
