CERTIFICATE RELATING

nath with the goldstnith, it cannot find the way to the Mint. And thus*
much fot the fast. ἱ

Fon the causes with the remedia, we have heard many propositidns
made, as well by the Lotd Knevet, who assisted usin this conference‚ ῥὶς 5
by the merchants3 of which propofitions few were new unto us, and much.
less can> be new to your Lordlhips÷ but yet although upon former consul·- l
tations, we are not unacquainted what is more or less likely to stand with. l:
your Lordships grounds and opinions, we thought it neverrhcless the best {1
fruit of our diligence to set them down in articles, that your Lordstfips li
with more ease may discard or entertain the particulam, beginning with 1.
those which you-r Lordships do point at in your lcttcrs, and so descend- '=
ing rothe rest. y l

THE first proposition is, ronching the disproportion of the price be· l
rween gold and filver, which is now brought to bed, upon the point of '²
fourtecn to one, being before but twelve to one. This we take to be
an evidenr cause of scarcity of filver at the Mint, but such a cause as will
hardly receive a tremedy ς for either your Lordships must draw down again
the price of gold, or advance the price of silver3 whercof the one is go-
ing back from thar which 'ts so lately done, and whereof you have* spund
good effect‚ and the other is a thing of dangerous consequence in respest
of the loss to all moneyed men in their debts‚ gentlemen in their rents,
the King in his custom5‚ and the common subject in rai-sing the price of
things vendible. And upon this point it is fit we give your Lordssiips
understanding what the merchants intimated unto ug that the very voicing
or suspect of the raifing of the price of silves, if it be not cleared, wduld
make such a deadness and retention of money this vacation, as (to use
their own words) will be a misery to the merchams, so that we were
forced to use protestation‚ that there was no such intent. ’ ’

THE second proposition is, touehing the charge of coinage ς wherdin it
was confidently avouched by the met-chaum, that if the coinage were brought
from two {hillings unto eighteen pence, asir was in Qucen Elizabeth's
time, the King would gain more in the quantity than he stiould ‘lose in
the price: and they aided themselves with that argument, that the King
had been plcased to abate his coinage in the other metal, and found good
of it; which argument, though it doth admit a difference, because that
abatemcnt was couplcd with the raising of the price, whereas this is to'go
alone, yet ncvettheless it seemed the officers of the Mint were not unwil-
ling ro give way to some abatement‚ although they presumed it would be
of small effect, because that abatement would not be equivalent to that
price which Spanifh filver bears with the goldsmitlu but yet it may be used
as an experiment of state, being recoverable at his Maicsty's pleasurc.

Tm: third proposition is, concerning the exportation of filver more than
in former times, whercin we fell first upon the trade into the East Indies,
concerning which it was materially in our opinions answered by the mct—
clmnts of that company, thar the filvcr which supplies that trade being gene-
rally Spaniss) ‚mone-ys, would not be brought in but for that trade, so that it
sucks in as well as it draws forth. Audit was added likewise, that as long
as the Low Countries maintained that trade in the Indies‚ it would help
little though our trade were dissblved, because that filver which is exported
immediately by us to the Indies, would bc drawn out of this kingdom for
the Indies immediately by the ‘Dutch3 and for the filvcr exportcd to the
Levant, ir was thought to beno great matter. As for other exportation‚
