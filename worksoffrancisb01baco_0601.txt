Dublin, will yet ingage your self personally into Ophalie (being our Lien„
t'enant) when you have there so many inferiors able, might victual a forr, or
scel< ‘revenge against those who have larcly prospered against our forces And
when we call to mind how far the sun harh run his course, and what depend—
eth'upon the timely plantation of garrisons in the North, and how <great scan-
dal it would be to our honour to leave that proud rebel uxi-inlustri, when
we have with vs) great an expee‘cation os our enemies engaged'our selves-
fo'f‘ar‘ in the astion3 so that without that be done, all those former course-5
will· prove like via navis in mari.- bcfides that our power, which hitherto
lga'a‘ffi be'en dreaded by potent enemies, will now even bc held contemptible
amongst our rebels: We must plainly charge you, according to the dutv you
detero us, so to unite soundness of jndgmenr to the zeal you have to 'do us
fetide-e, as with all speed to pass thither in such sort, as the axe might be put
Δ Ἠὀτοοῑ ofthat tree, which harh been the treasonable stock from whom

'‘inany poisoned plants and grafts have been derivcd3 by which proceedings
ofyours, we may neither have cause to repent of our imploymcnt of your
self for omitting those opportunities to {horren the wars, nor receive in the
’ὅγε ‘of the world imputation of so much weakness in our sclfto begin a work
without better forefight‚ what would be the end of our excessive charge, the
adventure of our peoples lives, and the holding up of our own greatnes3against
a‘wretch, whom we have raised from the dust, and who could never prosper,
if the charges we have been put to were orderly imployed.]

it 'was upon no other foundation than to which your self did ever advise‘us
as much as any, which was to affail the northern traitor, and to plant garri-
sons in his counrry3 it being ever your firm opinion, amongst other out
eOuneil, to conclude that all that was done in other kind in Ireland, was
but waste and consumption]
Η ER Majesty in her letter of the 9th of August to my Lord of Effex and
thess¹council of Ireland‚ when after [Wlmster journey, they began in a new
time to diffuade the northern journey in her excellent car, quickly finding a
