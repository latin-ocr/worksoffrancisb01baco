OF THE INTERPRETATION'

grapher‘s do their descriptions by globes, <making one philosophy fot heaven*i
{md another for under heaven, as in effe& they do.

So if the moral philosophers, that have spent such an infinite quantity of -
debate touching good, and the highest good, had cast their eye abroad upon

nature, and beheld the appetite that is' in a-ll things to receive and to gives - ,

the one motion affecting preservation, and the other multiplic-uriom which
appetites arc most evidently seen in living creatures, in the plcasure of nou·-

filhmcnt and generati¹0n3 and iri man d'o'malee the aptest and most natural ⁸ ⁴

division of all his desti-es, being ciehcr of sense of pleasure, or sense of
owcr3 and in the universal framc of the world are‘figured, the one in the
ξυιυς of heaven which issue forth, and the other in the lap of the earth which·
takes in: And again, if they had observed the motion of congruity, o'r ss-
tuation of the parts in respect of the whole, evidcnt in so many particulars ε ⁷
And lastly‚ if they had considered the motion (familiar in attraffion of things)
to approach tothat which is higher in the same kind : W hen by these obser-
vationis, so easy and concurring in natural philosophy, they should have
found out this qua-ternion. of good, in enjoying or fruition, effecting ot· o»
peration, eonsenting or proportion, and approach or alsumption3 they
would have saved and abridged much of their long and wandring diseoutses
of pleasure, verme, duty and religion. So likcwise in this same logick and
rhetorick, or asts of argument and grace of speech, if the great masters of
thern would but have gone a form lower, and looked but into the observa>-
t'ions of grammar concerning the kinds of word& their derivations‚ de·
flcxions and syntax, specially inriching the same, with the helps of several
languages, with their differing proprieties of wordS, phrases and tropes;
they might have found out more and better footstcps of common reason«,
help of disputation, and advantages of cavillation‚ than many of these which
they have propounded. So again, a man should be thought to dally, if he
did note how the figures of rhetoriek and musick, are many of them the
sam& The repetitions and tradustioris in speech, and the reports and haunt*-
ings of sounds in mufick, are the very same things. Plutarch harh almost
made a book of the Lacedernonian kind of jesting, which joined ever plea—
sure with distaste. Sir, (saith a man of art to ‘Philip King of Macedon,
when he controllcd himin his faculty) God forbid your fortune should be
fitch as to know thefi' things better than Ι. ln taxing his ignoranee in his
art, he represented to him the perpetual greatness of his fortune, leaving
him no vacant time for so mean a skill. Now in xnufick it is one of the
ordinariest flowers to fall from a discor-d, or hard tunc, upon a sweet accord.
'she figure that Cicero and the rest commend, as one of the best poi-urs of
elegancy, which is the fine chccking of expce'tation, i's no less well known
to the musicians, when they have a special grace in flying the close οι·
cadence. And these are no allusions but direct communities, the stime de-
lights of the mind being to be found not only in mulick, rhetorick, but in
moral philosophy, policy and other knowledges, and that obscure in the one,
which is more apparent in the othcr3 yea, and that discovered in the one,
which is not found at all in the othcr3 and so one science greatly aiding to»
the invention and augmentation of another. And therefore, without this
intercourse, the axioms of sciences will fall out to be neither full nor truc 3
but will be such opinions, as Aristotlein some places doth wisely censure,
when he saith, Thefi are the opinions Ofpcvfins that have respa? but to a
few thing-va So then we see, that thistnote leadcth us to an administration
