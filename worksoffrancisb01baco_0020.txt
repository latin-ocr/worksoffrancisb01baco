¹ THE LIFE OF THE

ness of manners which adorn a great man. xHis second wife
was a daughter of Sir Antborzy Cooke, who had been precep-
tor to Edward the Sixth, 'and of whom historians have made
honourable mention for his skill in the learned languages.
Neither have they forgot to celebrate this Lady, on the same

't ⁶ account. To the truth of which even an enemy bore testimo-

ny, while he reproached her with having transsated, from the
Latin, Bishop Jewel's apology for the Church of Englcmdr
SUCH were the parents of Francis Belem, whose Life 1 am
writing. Of two sons, by this marriage, he was the youngest:
and born at Υ ork-House in the Strand, the twenty—second of

· January 1561. As he had the good fortune to come into the

world at a period of· time when arts and sciences were esteemed
and cultivated, by the Great and Powerful, almost in the-same
degree they are now neglected3 so he brought with him a ca*
pacity for every kind of knowledge, useful and ornamental.
An original geniuS, formed not to receive implicit notions of
thinking and reasoning from what was admitted and taught be-
fore him3 but to prescribe laws himself, in the empire of learn-
ing, to his own and succeeding ages.

HE gave marks, very early, of a pre'gnant and happy dispo·
fition, far above his years. We are told that Qeen Elizabeth
took a particular delight in trying him with questions ; and re-
ceived so much satisfaction from the good sense and manliness
of his answers, that she was wont to call him, in mirth, her
young Lord Keeper. One saying of his deserves to be remem-
bered. The Qeen having asked him his age, while he was
yet a boy3 he answered readily, that he was just two years
younger than her happy reign.

Or his education I know no particulars, till he was sent to
study in the university of >Cambridge under Dr. Whitgift‚ af-
terwards Archbishop of Canterburjy: and I find he was entered

ffirhomeof 73⁴i7zity-C0llege in his twelfth year. The progress he made

was rapid and uncommon: for he had run through the whole
circle of the liberal arts, as they were then taught, before he
was sixteen. But what is far more surprizing3 he began, even
then, to see through the emptiness and futility of the philoso-
phy in vogue: and to conjecture, that useful knowledge must
be raised on other foundations, and built up with other mate-
rials, than had been employed through a tra& of many centu-
