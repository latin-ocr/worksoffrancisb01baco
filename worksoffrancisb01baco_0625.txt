IMPOSITIONS ΟΝ MERCHANDISES.

ΒοΜῐῑτιΜεε he abolissieth them in part, and letteth them stand in
part, as 11 E. ΙΙ. the record of the Alutuum, and 14 E. 111. the
printed statute, whereof I {hall speak more anon.

SOMETIMES that no imposition shall beser during the time that the
grants made ofsubsidics by parliament ihall continue, as 47 E. 111.

SoMET 1 Msss that they {hall cease ad voluntatem nostram.

A ND sometimes that they shall hold over their term prefixed or ass'eised.

ΑΜ, which ssaeweth that the King did not disclaim them as timanthi,
sor astus legitimus non recipit tempus aut conditionem. 1f it had been a
disaffirmance by law, they must have gone down infidias, but now you see
they have been tempered and qualitied as the King litw convenient.

’ THE fifth consideration, is of that which is offered by way of obiectiom
which is, first, that such grants have been usually made by consent of parlia-

’ ment3 and secondly‚ that the statutes of subfidics of tonnage and poundage
have been made as a kind of stint and liminatiori, that the Kiug should hold
himself unto the proportion so granted and not impose further ; the rather
because itis express'ed in some of these statutes of tonnage and poundage,
sometimes by way of protestation, and sometimes by way osc-ondition that
they than not be taken ln precedent, or that the King shall not impose any
further rates or noveltys, as 6 R. 11. 9 R. ΙΙ. 13 H. lV. 1H. V. whien

- subsidics of tonnage and poundage have such clauses and cautionis,

To this objeffion 1 give this answer. First, that it is not strange with
Klng8‚ for their own better strength, and the better eontentment of their
peop1e‚ to do those things by parliament which nevcrtheless have perfec'tion

¹ enough without parliament. We see their own rights to the crown which
⁴ ate inherent, yet they take recognition of them by parliament. And there
was a special reason why they {hould do it in this case, for they had found by
experience that if they had not consent in parliament to the setting ofthem
up, they could n0t have avoided suit in parliament for the taking of them
down. Befides, there were some things requisite in the manner of the levy
for the better strengthning of the same, which pet-case could not bc done
without parliament, as the taking the oath of the party touching the value,
the inviting of the discovery of concealment of custom by giving the moiety
to the informer, and the like. Now in special for the statutes of subfidies of
tonnage and poundage‚ Inote three things. first, that the consideration
of the grant is not laid to be for the restraining of inipofitions‚ but expreflly
fot· the guarding of the sea. Sceondly, that it is true that the ancient form
is more peremptory, and the modern more submissz for in the ancient
form sometimes they insert a flat condition that the King thal] not further
impose3 in the latter they humbly pray that the merchants may be demeaned
without oppress'lon, paying those rate-<3 but whether it be liipplieation, or
whether it be condition, it rather implieth thc King hath a power-5 for else
both were needless, for conditio anrterlitur ubi libertaspraesitmitur‚ and the
word oppression seemcth to refer to excessive itnposstions. And drirdly,
that the statutes of tonnage and poundage ate but annulati-w and not pri-va-
tive of the King's power precedent, appeareth notably in the three pene<
overpluS, which is paid by the met-chaumstrange-rs, which thould 'ee taken
awayquite, ifthose statutes were taken to be limitationis-3 for inrhar, as
was touched before, the rates are equal iu the generality between subit-dx
andstrangers, and yet that impositiom notwithstanding any liipposed restric-
tion ofthcsc aeis of subsidies ot'tonnage and poundage, reniaiueth at this da).
