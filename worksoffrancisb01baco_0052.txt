his great merit in obedience and submiffion3 in· the interest
he had among the Commons, and in being able to influence 1116
lower House of Parliament: a service which 116 magnifies as
more important in a Chancellor, than to judge in equity be-

general, distinguished him by an uncomrnon mark of favour
and confidence. An objection having been started in the
house of Commons, that a seat there was incompatible with
the office of Attorney-General, which required his frequent

A Faw days after hc had 1116 seals delivered tohim, the
King went a progress into Scotland, carrying with him the Fa-

business, public or private, was addrefi'ed3 and according to
his fancy, for the most part determined. The great affair that
employed the deliberations of his counsel about this time, and
had a fatal influence on his conduct ever after, was the mar->
riage of Prince Charles with the Infanta of Spain. In this re—
solution, tho contrary to all the rules of good policy, 116
