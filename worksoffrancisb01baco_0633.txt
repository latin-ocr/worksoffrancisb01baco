THE PENAL LAWSe

Tuus have Ι according to your Majcsty's reference certilicd my opinion
of that part of Sir Stephen ProcJor’s proieci& which conccrneth penul laws:
which Ido wholly and most humbly submit to your Maiesty's high wil'-
dom and judgment, wilhing withal that some conferenee may bc had by
Mt. Chanccllor and the Bai-ons, and the rest of the learned counseI, to draw
the service toa better perfeffion. And most specially⁵ that the travelsthcre-
in taken may bc confidered and discerned of by the Lord Tre-asum, whose
care and capacity is such, as he doth always either find or choose that which
ιὶε best for your Majesty's service.

THE recompence unto the gentleman‚ it is not my part to presumc to
touch, otherwise than to put your Majesty in remembrance of that propor-
tion, which your Majesty is plcascd to give to others out of the profits they
bring in, and perhaps with a great deal less labour and charge.

A Certificate to ‘the Lords of the Council‚ upon in-

¹formation given, touching the scarcity of filver at

. . the Mint, and reference to the two ChancellorS,
and the King’s Sollicitor.

C CORDING unto your Lordstiips letters unto us directed‚ ground]

Α cd upon the information‚ which his Maiesty hath received con-

cerning the scarcity of filver at the Mint, we have called before
us as well the officers of the Mint, as some principal merchanrs, and spent
two whole asternoons in the examination of the bufiness; wherein we kept
this order, first to examine the fact, then the causes, with the remedies.
AND for the fact, we dire-{ted the officers of the Mint to give unto us
a distinguished account how much gold and filver harh yearly been brought
into the Mint, by the space of fix whole years last past, more specially for
the last three months succceding the last proclamation touching the price
,of gold, to the end we might by the suddenness of the fall, discern whe-
ther that proclamation might be thought the efficient cause of the present
*scarc‘ity 3 upon which account it appears to us, that during the space of fix
years aforesaid, there hath been still degrees of dcc-ay in quantity of the
silvei· brought to the Mint, but yet so, as within these last three months
it harh grown fai· beyond thc proportion of the former time, in so much
as there comes in now little or none at all. And yet notwithstanding it
is some opinion, as well amongst the officers of the Mint as the merchants‚
that the state need be the less apprehensive of this cffect, because it is like
to be but temporary, and. neither the great flush of gold that is come into
the Mint fince the proclamation‚ nor on the other fide the great scarcity of
ssyer, can continue in proportion as it now doth.

’ ANOTHER point of the fact, which we thought fit to examine, was, whe-
ther the scarcity of filver appeared generally in the rcalm, or only at the Mint ς
whercin it was confess'ed by the merchants, that silvcr is continually importcd
intothe rcalm² and is found ssirring amongst the goldsmiths, and otherwise,
much like asin former times, although in respect ofthe greater price which it
