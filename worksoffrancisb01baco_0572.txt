OF THE TRUE GREATNESS

till the time of Jo· vianus For so it was auedgcd. by ‚sueh- as Qpp'o'fffl
thei ilelves to the rendering Ns bzs upon the distronourable retreat Ossthe: Ro
man army out of Pers a t>At which time it was avouched‚ that the· Romans
>by the ipaee of 800 year,s had never before that day, made any ceffion 01,-
renunciation to any part of their territory, whereof they had once· hadg- a
constant and quiet posscssiOn And )et neven-heleis, immediately afterthc
{hort reign of Jo manus, and towards the end of the joint.. reign af
Valentinianus and Valens, which were his immediate succe'flors, and milda
more in the times sucoecding, the Roman empire, notwithstanding t'he
magnitude thereof‚ became no better than a carea1e, whereupon all the
ivu lwues, and birds of prey of the world, did seize and ravine for-many
ages, for a perpetual monument of the essential difference betweenthe
reale of miles, and the scale of forces. And therefore upon these rea-
lons and examples, ue may safely conclude, that latgeneis ossrerritory
is so far from being a thing inseparablc from greatness of power, as it is
many times contrariam and incompatible‚with the same. But to make-a
reduffion of that error to a truth, it will stand thus, that then greatness
of territory addeth strength, when it harh these four conditions: . ny

First, That the territories be compacied, and not dispersed.
. Second), That the region which is the heart and leat of the state, be
sufficient to support those parts, which are but provinces and additions.
Thirdly‚ That the arms or martial virtue of the state be in some degree
answerable to the greatness of dominion.
And Lastly‚ That no part or province of the state be utterly unprofitable,
but do confer lome ule or service to the state.

T HE first of these is manifestly true, and scarcely needeth any explication.
For if there bc a state that consisteth of icattered points instead of lines,- and
ssender lines instead of latitudes‚ it can nev er be rond, and' m the solid figure
is strength. But what speak we of mathematical principles? The realon of
state is exidcnt‚ that it the parts of an estate be disjoined and remote, and
so be inter-rupted with the provinces of another sovereignty3 theycannot
pofiibly have ready succours, in case of invasion, nor ready suppression, in
case of rebellion, nor ready recovery in cale of lois or alienation by either
of both meins And therefore we see what an endless work the King of
Spain harh had to recover the Low Cemetria, although it were to' him
patrimony and not purchase ‚ and that chiefly in regard of the great distance.
So we see that our nation kept Calais a hundred years space after it lost
the rest of france, in regard of the near s tuat10n‚ and yet in the end they
that were nearer, ²carriedD it by surprizc, and over· ran succour.

'I ΗΕΒ EF on E Titus Quintius made a good compariton of the state of the
Achaiam to atortoise, which 15 safe when' it 15 retircd within the ffie11,but
if any part be put forth, then the part exposed endangereth all the rest. . For
so it is with states that have provinces disperscd, the defence whereof doth
commonly consume and decay, and sometimes ruin the rest of the estate.
And so likewise we may observe, that all the great monarchics‚ the Persians,
the Romans, (and. the like of the Turks) they had not any provinces to the
'which they needed to demand access through the country of another:
neither had they any long races or narrow angles of territory, which were
environed or clasped in with foreign statess but their dominions were
