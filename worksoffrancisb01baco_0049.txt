Lo-RD CHANCELLOR Base-obi.

B'a‘con sent a writing of that purport, on which there are seve-
ral observations in the King’s own hand. 1 will only quote
one paffage from it: “ All these points of mercy and favour to
“¹ Somerset are to be understood with this limitation ς if he
“ do not, by his contemptuous and insolent carriage at the
“ Bar, make himself incapable and unworthy of them.” The
*King’s remark in the margin is in these words: “ That
“ danger is well to be foreseen, lest he upon the one part
‘⁸‘ commit unpardonable errors 3 and I on the other part
‘¹ seem to punish him in the spirit of revenge.’' Somer-
fit 'was not to be tried for any offence against the King3
but· for the barbarous murder of a private man and his friend.
What then means the contemptuous carriage that is so much
apprehended? What are the unpardonable errors it may lead
him to commit? If he refled‘ted on a Master, to whom he had
been so much obliged, only for giving him up to a fair and equal
tryal, to a tryal by many circumstances rendered inevitable;
that would, in the opinion of all mankind, only aggravate his
crime, and furnish a new motive to that master for letting the
sentence of justice pais upon him in all its rigor. After these
particulam, I may venture to mention a fa& related by Sir

*Anthony Weldon, who says that when the lieutenant of the Coun

of K.

Tower, Sir George More, came and told the Earl, he must 7⁰22· ¹·

prepare for his tryal on the morrow, he absolutely refused to
appear unless they dragged him to it by violence 3 adding, that
the King durst not bring him to tryal. Astonished at such
'rash and dangerous expreffionS, the Lieutenant, tho it was
then midnight, went and demanded an audience of the King,
to inform him of what had paffed. James‚ upon hearing his
story, burst into a passion of tears, and intreated More to use
> his utmost skill upon his prisoner and soothe him, by whatever
meanS, into proper temper and submiffion. This More un-
dertook to do, and by a stratagem effected it. W eldon affirms
he had this story from the Lieutenant’s own mouth: and tho
he is a partial writer, and indulges himself in a humour of licen-
tious scandal, the authentic vouchers I have produced render
his anecdote not improbable. Other circumstances, mentioned
” by t'hose who have profeffedly written of this reign, I therefore

omit, and shall onlyvadd, that there is in the Cabala a letter to Cabala,
King James from Some7jset after his condemnation, of a very 3⁶²5& Edit-
