LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. xxi

into prostitute adulation and servile homage. This was be—
come the fashionable language among the Clergy as well as
Laity3 and James heard himself daily addreffed to, by the
titles of sacred and divine: titles which discover the meanness
rather than the dignity of human nature3 and which, applied
to him, were glaringly ridiculous. He had not one princely
quality. The arts of governing a kingdom in peace he either
did not, or would not understand: and his horror os war was
constitutional and unconquerable. lt may therefore seem un-
accountable that a King of this temper should treat his parlia-
ments with more haughtiness than any of his predeceffors had
ever done. But he had been told that Englcmd was neither to
be exhausted nor provoked ε and his ac‘tions shewed that he
believed so, according to the letter. The truth is, that as pu-
fillanimity will talk bigger on some occafions than true valor
on any ; he meant to make himself formidable to his people‚
that they might not discover how much he was afraid of them.

. Tno he did not succeed in the union of the Kingdoms‚ he
found his Judges‚ in an affair of a fimilar kind, more complai-
sant than the great Council of the nation had been: I mean the
naturalization of all Scotsmen born fince his acceffion to the

throne of England. This was adjudged by Sir Edward Coke gss5⁰ssfss1
in the great case of Calvia ; as it had been argued at large be-1i's.1⁷,'.‘²1{}5.⁰'
fore all the Judges by Sir Francis Bacon. The affair is now

no longer of importance to either Kingdom: but one affertion

of our author, on that occafion, ought not to be forgot. He
roundly affirms, that monarchies do not subfist like other go-
vernment8‚ by a precedent law; and that submiffion to them

is grounded upon nature.

· ΙΝ 1610 he published another treatise, entitled‚ Of the Wis- Αη. 1510.
dom of the Ancients. This work bears the same stamp of an m
original andinventive genius with his other performances. Re-
solving not to tread in the steps of those who had gone before
him, men, according to his own expreflion, not learned be-
yond certain common places 3 he strikes out a new trac't for
himself, and enters into the most secret receffes of this wild and
shadowy region3 so as to appear new on a known and beaten
subje& Upon the whole, if we cannot bring ourselves readily
