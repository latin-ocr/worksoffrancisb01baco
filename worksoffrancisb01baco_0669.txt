FILUM LABYRINTHI.

tain kind, wherein magiek and superstition harh playcd in all times. The
mechanical person, if he can refine an invention, or put two or three obser-
various or praefices, together in one, or couple things better with their use,
or {sake the worlrfin less or greater volume, ‚taketh himself for an inventor.
Sb‘ e saw well, that men either persuade themselves ot* new inventionsas
of impoffibilities ς οι· else think they are already extant, but in secret and in
few handu or thar they account of those little industries and additions, as
of irwentions, all which turncth to the averting of their minds from any just
at dcconstant labour‚ to invent further in any quantity.

i 3'2 HE thought also, when men did set before themselves the variety and
perfectiori of wmks, produced by mechanical arts ς they are apt rather to ad-
mire the provilions of man, than to apprehend his wants; not confidering,
that the original inventionS, and conclusions of nature, which are the lise os
all that variety, are not many, nor deeply ferched ε and that the rest is but
the subtile and ruled motion of the instrument and hand 3 ancl that the lhop
therein is not unlike the library, which in such number of books containeth
(fot the far greater part) nothing but iterations, varied sometimes in form,
Quint new in substance. So he saw plainly, that opinion of store was
qqcanse of want3 and that both works and doeirines appear many, and
§referv-
ἐμήν, HE thought also, that knowledge is uttcred to men in aform, as if
gyefy, thing were finished3 fot it is reduced into arts and method53 which
intimis divisions do seem to include all that may be. And how weakly so-
ς εἱῐὴε parts are filled, yet they carry the shew and reason of a total ς and

reby the writings of some received authors go for the very art: whereas
mitiquity used to deliver the knowledge which the mind of man had gather-
cd, in observations³ aphorisms, or ihort and dispersed sentences, or small
tractatos of some parts that they had diligently meditated and laboured3
which did invite men, both to ponder that which was invented, and to add
and ⁵supply further. But now, sciences are delivered as to be believed and
accepted, and not to be examined and further discovered3 and the suecesl
sion is between master and disciple, and not between inventor and continuet
or adv-mcci· ς and therefore sciences stand at a stay, and have done for many
ages, and that which is positive is fixed, and that which is question is kept
question, so as the columns of no further proceeding are pirched. And there-
fore he saw plainly, men had eut themselves off from further invention 3 and
that it is no marvel, that that is not obtained which hath not been attempt-
ed, bur rather lhut out ancl debarred.

5. HE thought also, that knowledge is almost generally fought either for
delight and satisfafflon, or for gain or professIOn, or for credit and orna-
ment, and that every of these arc as Atalanta’s bans, which hinder the racc
of invention. For men are so far in these eoutscs from secking to increase
the mass of knowledge, as of that mass which is, they will take no more
than will serve their turn: and if any one amongst so many seekerh know·
ledge for it sels, yet he rather seeketh to know the variety of things, than to
discern of the truth and causes of them 3 and if his inquisitionbe yet more
severe, yet it tendeth rather to judgment than to invention; and rather to
discover truth in controversy, than new matter3 and ifhis heart be so
large as he propoundeth to himself further discovery or invention, yet it
is rather of new discourse and speculation of causes, than of effeets and
operations. And as for those that have so much in their mouths, aetion
