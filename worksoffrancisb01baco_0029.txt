LORD CHANCELLOR BACON. xi

himself with much gallantry, she raised h'is enemy, Sir Roherz
Cecil, to be Secretary of State3 tho he had earnestly solicited
that post for another. He had often applied to her in behalf
ofBacon, and asked sor him, with all the warmth of friendship,
the place of Solicitor General, but had been always refused.
Cecil, who mortally hated Effex, and had entertained a secret
jealousy of Bucon, on account of his superior talents, represented
the latter to the Qieen as a man of mere speculation 3 as one
wholly given up to philosophical enquiries, new indeed and a-
mufing, but fanciful and unsolid: and therefore more likely to
distra& heraffairsthan to serve her usesully and with proper judg-
ment. Bacon however was this man's coufin - german 3 his father and
the Lord Bzcrleigl) having married two fisters: but Ambition
knows neither merit nor relation. This unworthy treatment
from so near a kinsman carried Bacon into very free expostula*
tions on his courtly artifices, as he endeavoured in secret to crush
the man whom yet he pretended openly to serve ε and these
repeated disappointments sunk so deep into his spirit, that he
was several times on the point of retiring for ever, and even of
hiding his grief and resentment in some foreign country. Effex,
who could but ill brool< the mortification of a denial, finding
himself unable to serve his friend in a public way, would needs
make up the loss to him out of his own private fortune: and
if we may believelBufhel, he bestowed upon him about this ffs'ff'⁵3}
time Twitenhmn-Park and its garden of Paradise. Whether it p- 1}- p ’
was that or some other of his lands, the donation was so very
considerable, that Bucen, as himself acknowledges in his apology,
sold it afterwards, even at an under price, for no less than
eighteen hundred pounds. A bounty so noble, accompanied
too, as we know it was, with all those agreeable distinctions
that to a mind, delicately senfible, are more obliging than the
bounty it sels, must kindle in the breast of a good man the
most ardent sentiments of gratitude‚ and create an inviolable
attachment to such a benefactor. What then are we to think
of Bacon, when we find him, after this nobleman's unhappy
fate, publishing to all Englcmd a Declaration of the treasons of
Robert Earl of Effex ? This behaviour drew upon him a heavy
and general hatred at that time 3 which was not extinguiffied
even by his death, but continues still, in the writings of more

than one historian, an imputation on his memory. As this
