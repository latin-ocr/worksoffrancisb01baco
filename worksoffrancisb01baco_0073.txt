LORD CHANCELLOR BAcou. li

that he had the found, distinet, comprehensive knowledge of
Amstotle‚ with all the beautiful lights, graces, and-embelish-
ments of Cicero. To this commendation of his- talentS, the
Learned throughout Europe have given their common sanction,
and own him for the father of the only valuable philosophy,
that of fact and observation.

IT remains then to consider him, more particularly than
we have hitherto done, in this most known and conspicuous
part of his character ; where his merit is unquestionably great
and entirely his own. For, to the writings of the antients he
was not, he could not, be obliged. They had either mistaken
the right road to natural knowledge3 or if any of them struck
into it by chance, finding the way difficult‚ obscure, and te-
dious, they soon abandoned it for ever. He owed to himself
alone, to a certain intellectual sagacity, that bearn of true
discernment which shewed him at once, and as it were by
intuition, what the most painful enquirerS, for more than
twenty ages backward‚ had searched after in vain. And here
let me observe towards him the same impartiality I have
hitherto aimed at: and, in order to know what he really did
as a philosopher, place before the reader a short view of the
state of learning in Europe, from the dark period of Gothicism
down to the fixteenth century. But let me at the same time
acknowledge‚ that this account will be only a rude and im-
perse& sketch 3 confisting of a few detached particulam, with-
out much order or method.

ALTHO the great era of ignorance has been fixed, justly
enough, to those times when the northern Nations‚ like a
mighty inundation‚ overspread the face of Europe3 yet itis
no less certain that barbarism and corruption were entered into
arts and sciences ere the Savages had made any impresfion on
the Roman Empire. Under them indeed, that darkness which
had been long growing on the world, and gradually extin-
guishing every light of knowledge, soon became total, and
threatened to be perpetual. In the eighth century, we find
that the highest ambition of the Clergy was to vie with one
another in chanting the public service, which yet they hardly
understood. This important emulation run so high between the &affy-L
Latin and Frencl) priesthood, that Charlemagne, who was then ],,’.ὀ’ξ, ἶΪ”’

at Rome, found it neceffary to interpose‚ and decide the Con- 4' p ²‘
