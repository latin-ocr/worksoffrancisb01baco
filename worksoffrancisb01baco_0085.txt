looked upon as extensive and valuable for that age, when the
whole work was to be begun. This collection, which did not
appear till after his death, has been generally considered as
detached from, and independent on his general plan: and
therefore his defign in ‘making and recording these experi—

-ments has not been duly attended to by the reader. They
are a common repofitory or store- house of materiaIS, not
arranged for ornament and show, but thrown loosely together
sor the service of the philosopher: who may from thence& sele&

that Organ or Engine already described, build up some part of
an axiomatical philosophy, which 15 the crown and completion

produfflon of all species according to the common laws of na-

ture3 that of preter—generations or of births deviating from the
stated rule3 and thirdly, the history of nature as confined or

discloses to us a new face of things, and as it were another
world of appearances. The use of such a history he reckons
two- -fold3 either the knowledge of qualities m themselves. or
to serve for the first matter of a true and useful philosophy.

With this view only did our Author make and gather together
⁴the miscellaneous colleffion I am speaking of. That many par-

ticular experiments have been found doubtful or false cannot be

wondered at: the whole was then a tract of science uncultivated
and desert. If several considerable men, treading in the path
he struck out for them, have gone farther and surveyed it more
exaffly than he did, yet to him is the honour of their disco-
veries in a manner due. It was Columbus alone who imagined
there might be a new World3 and who had the noble boldness
to go in t³·sealch of it, thro an ocean unexplored and immense.
He succeeded in the attempt3 and led his followers into a sp a·

cious continent, rich and fruitful. If succeeding adv enturpers
have penetrated farther than he into its several regions, marked
out and distinguished them with more accuracy3 the result of
these discoveries has less extended their farne than it has raised
and enlarged his.
