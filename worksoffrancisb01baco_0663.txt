nor shall not be poffibly able to gnide or keep on his course aright. That
those that have been conversant in experience and observation‚ have used,
when they have intended to discover the cause of any effen, to fix their eon—
fideration narrowly and exaffly upon that effe& it sclf, with all the eircum-
stances thereos, and to vary the trial thereof as many ways as ean be devised3
which‘ course amounteth but to a tedious curiosity, and ever breakcth off in
woudring and not in knowing. And that they have not used to enlarge
their observation to match and sort that effe& with instanees of a diverse
subicit, which must of neceffity be before any cause be found out. That
they have passed over the observation of instances vulgar and ignob1e, and
flayed their attention chiefly upon instanees of rnark; whereas the other sort
ate for the most part more significant, and of better light and infor-marion.
That every particular that workcth any effeet, is athing compounded (more
or less) of diverse fingle natures (more manifest and more obscure) and that
it appeareth not to whether of the natures the effe& is to be ascribcd5 and
yet notwithstanding they have taken a course without breaking particulars,
and reducing them by exclufions and inclufions to a definite point, to con-
clude upon induhions in gross, which empirical course is no less vain than
the¹ scholastieal. That all such as have sought aetion and work out of their
enquIry, have been hasty and pressing to discover some praefices for present
use'‚· >and not to discover aonms, joining wi'th thern the new affignations as
their suretieS. That the forcrunning of the mind to frame recipcs upon
axi³6ms at the entrance, is like Atalanta's golden ball that hindereth and
interrupteth the coursc3 and is to be inhibited till you have ascended to a eer-
tain stage and degree of generalities3 which forbearance will be libcrally re-
compenced in the end: And that chance discovereth new inventions by one
and one, but seience by knots and elusters. That they have not collected
sufficient quantity of particulam, nor them in sufficient certainty and sub-
tilty‚ not ofall several kinds, nor with those advantages and diseretions in
the entry and forring which are requisite‚ and of the wcak manner of collect-
ing natural history, which harh been used. Lastly, that they had no know-
ledge of the formulary of interpretation, the work whereof is to abridge
expet-leuce, and to make things as certainly found out by axiom in {hort time,
as by infinite experiences in ages.

HAT the cautcls and devices put in praelice in the delivery of know-
ledge for the covering and palliating of ignor-ance‚ and the graeing and
over-valuing of that they utter‚ are without number3 but none more bold
and more hurtful than two: the one, that·men have used of a few obser-
vations upon any subjeeh to make a solemn and formal αττ,- by filling it up
with discourse, accommodatIng it with some circumstances and direfflons to
practice, and digesting it into method‚ whereby men grow satisfied and se-
cure, as if no more enquiry were to bc made of that martem the other, *that
men have used to discharge ignorance with credit, in defining all those cffths
which they cannot attain unto, to bc out of the compass of att and human
endeavour. That the very stylcs and forms of utteranee ate so many charasters
of imposture, some chusing a style of pugnacity and contention‚ some of
satire and reprehensiom some of plausible and tcmpting similitudes and ex-
amples, some of great words and high discoutse‚ some of lhort and dark sen-
tence3‚
