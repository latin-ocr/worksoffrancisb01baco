and others, and justly to be derived either in respect of the hostility of y

Spain, or in respect of the conditions‚ liberties and privileges of ‚those sub- ²

jests, and without charge, danger, and offence to the King of Spain und
his partisans. She hath taken upon her their defence and protee‘tion with·-
out any further avail or profit unto herself, than the honour and merit
of her benignity to the people that hath been pursued by their natural
King only upon passion ancl wrath‚ in such sort that he doth consume vhiis
means upon revenge. And, having to verify that which 1 said, thar‘ het
merits have extended to her greatest enemies 3 let ir be rcmembred what
hath paffed in that matter between the King of Spain and her: how in
the beginning of the troubles there, she gave and imparted to him faith-
ful and friendly advice touching the course that was to be taken for quiet-
ing and appeafing of them. Then lhe interposed herself to most justand
reasonable capitulations, wherein always should have been preserved nmo
him as ample interest, iurisdietion, and superiority in those countries as
he in right could claim, or a Prince well-minded would seek to have: and
(which is the greatest point) {he did by het advice, credit and policy‚ land
all good means, interrupt and appeach, that the same people by despair
should not utterly alien and distract themselves from the obedicnce of the
King of Spain, and. cast themselves into the arms of a strangcr: insomuch,
that it is most true, that she did ever persuade the Duke of Anjou from that
action, notwithstanding the affeffion {he bare to that Duke, and the obsti-
nacy which {he saw daily growing in the King of Spain. Lastly, to to'uch
the mighty general merit of this Queen, bear in mind, that her benignity
and beneficence hath been as large as the oppreffion and ambition of Spam.
For to begin with the church of Rome, that pretended apostolick see is
become bur a donativo cell of the King of Spain3 the vicar of Christ is
become the King of Spain's chaplains he parteth the coming in of ,the
new Pope, for the treasure of the old : he was wont to exclude but some
two or three cardinals, and to leave the eleetion of the rest3 but now he
doth include, and present direffly some small number, all incapableand
incompatible with the conclave, put in only for colour, except one ot
two. The states of Italy, they be like little quillcts of frechold being inter-
mixt in the midst of a great honour or lordlhip: France is turned up-
fide down, the subje& against the King, cut and manglcd infinirely, a coun-
try of Rodamonts and Roytelets, farmers of the ways 2 ‘Portugal usurp-ed
by no other title than strength and vicinity: the Low Countrjes warred
upon, because he seeketh, not to poffess them, for they were poss'css'ed'by
him before, but to plant there an absolute and martial governmem, and
to suppress their liberties: the like at this day attempted upon Arragon:
the poor India, whereas the Christian religion generally brought infran-
chisement of ssaves in all places where it came, in a contrary course are
brought from freemen to be ssaves, and ssaves of most miser-able condi-
tion: sundry trains and praefices of this King’s ambition in Germam,
Demark, Scotland, the east townS, are not unknown. Then it is her
governmem, and her government alone, that harh been the sconce and fort
of all Europe, which harh lert this proud nation from over-running all.
Is any state be yet free from his fastions erected in the bowels thercof3
if there be any state wherein this faetion is erected, that is not yet fircd with
civil troubles 5 if there be any state under his protectior] upon whom he
usurpeth ηοω if there be any subject to him that enjoycth rnodera'te

liberty
