was against his inclinati0n‚ as well as against his better sense of
things ; for as he knew well that his Master's true interest lay'
in a good understanding with his people, he had often advised
him to 0311 frequent parliamentS, and to throw himself on the
affections of the nation for> the support of his government.
Tho such advice was repugnant to all the maxims by which
that monarch wished to establish his power3 tho he had re-
solved to lay parliaments afide for ever, as daring encroachers
upon his prerogative,. who made themselves greater and
their prince less than became either: yet he was now pre-

injustice and oppreffiom Certain persons had obtained patents
from the King, which empowered them to set an annual fine on
